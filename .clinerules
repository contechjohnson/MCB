# Project Context Rules for AI Assistants

## ALWAYS READ THESE FILES FIRST
- START_HERE.md - Current project status
- CLAUDE.md - Development guide
- SCHEMA_V2_README.md - Database schema

## Current Phase
Schema v2.0 migration ready. Next: Run migration, build webhooks.

## Key Context
- This is a data collection system (not a dashboard)
- User does "vibe coding" - explain things simply
- Always use Firecrawl for web tasks
- Supabase MCP is installed for easy DB access
- Old code archived in _archive_2025_11_02/

## Immediate Goals
1. Test Supabase MCP
2. Run schema_v2.sql migration
3. Build webhook endpoints
4. Set up automated reporting
