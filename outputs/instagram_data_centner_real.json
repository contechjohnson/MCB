        "caption": "lol at the photo, but…peptides are so popular now and I get this question often. I’ve tried others as well but these are a few I find most interesting. Peptides should be done under a doctors supervision and prescribed, work with a provider to determine what if any peptides may be beneficial to you. Not medical advice. \n\n• SS-31 — Mitochondrial support. May help stabilize cardiolipin, support ATP production, and reduce oxidative stress for deeper cellular energy.\n\nHere are a few I use in my current protocol:\n • TA1 (Thymosin Alpha-1) — Immune support and supports resilience during stress.\n • BPC-157 — Gut + tissue repair. May help support gut lining integrity, balanced inflammation, and healthy recovery of soft tissues.\n • Tesamorelin — I like it for a little body re-comp at times. \n\nI’ve incorporated peptides on and off for 8 years, guided by data, labs, and my medical team. They aren’t a solve for sedentary lifestyle, poor diet or poor sleep. As always, work with your doctor and I only do peptide therapy under medical supervision. Also, the peptides that I take are prescribed I do not take research grade peptides.",

Here are science backed free or low cost protocols for health optimization. If you master these you will be healthier than 95% of people. No tech needed. I’ve been posting this content for many years but it can get lost among all of the other posts so will be pinning this! If you are interested in exploring what advanced therapies may be able to do for you, this page offers my experience and results from them as well! I do love the devices I have and they have made a big impact and can be used in an intentional way to help people heal quicker. I added a last slide as investments I would make if possible since I get this question all do the time. Hope this helps! Drop questions below. I also have a full YouTube video breaking this all down called low cost longevity on my channel. ❤️\n\nAlso including codes to save on the 3 investments I mentioned. \n\n@heavenlyheatsaunas code Kayla \n@jasprco code Kayla \n@aquatru code KaylaB",

These modalities work together, system-level, precision-driven, and have offered incredible results for me! If you have a question, feel free to to ask below and I’ll answer! \n\n1. Stress Reduction Your gut listens to your mind. Chronic stress elevates cortisol, weakens tight junctions, and accelerates leaky gut. Lower stress → stronger barrier → better digestion, detox, and nutrient absorption.\n\n2. @Seed Probiotics A next-gen microbiome tool. Clinically validated strains that support microbial diversity, reinforce the gut lining, and may enhance immune signaling. Your beneficial bacteria drive everything from digestion to mood. #seedpartner @seed\nKAYLA20 for 20% off at seed.com/kayla\n\n3. Oral BPC-157 Targeted support for mucosal repair. Helps maintain gut lining integrity, supports cellular renewal, and promotes a balanced inflammatory response, critical during stress, travel, or intensive protocols.\n\n4. Bonus: Fiber Optimization Fiber feeds your microbiome. It increases microbial diversity, supports SCFA production for gut lining health, stabilizes blood sugar, aids detoxification, and lowers inflammation. Most women under-consume fiber, even though it’s one of the strongest longevity levers. I am for 45-50g of fiber per day.\n\n5. Bonus: Food Diversity Your microbes thrive on variety. Eating 30–50 plant species per week increases microbial richness, enhances resilience, and improves metabolic flexibility. Diversity → stability → a stronger gut ecosystem that adapts and protects.",

Now don’t get me wrong, I still love the sun, and I don’t avoid it, I am just trying to find a balance between the benefits and a way to reverse some of the damage that I’ve done. This is a very nuanced topic this done in longevity! Vitamin D and the sun is definitely important for overall health and longevity, but I’m trying to find the best way to balance skin protection alongside that so I have landed on either using the mineral sunscreen on my face and neck or using a sun hat during times of high UV.\n\nFew things I’m excited about that I am trialing and doing soon! \n\n- GHK-Cu peptide. Will report back on my results \n- Loved the sofwave and Diamond facials with @drjasondiamond \n- Loved the salmon sperm and Vsels that I did this year with @regenwithdrnguyen \n- And super excited for “biofiller” in Dec and co2 next year. \nWill share thoughts on all treatments and what’s worth it. \n\nFor any Botox / filler questions — I have a entire YouTube video on this, but yes I get Botox 2x per year, but I have been testing what’s possible without it, I tried filler years ago in lips, I havnt done it in years though. \n\nWhat have you ladies tried that you love?

I use hyperbaric oxygen therapy as a longevity protocol focused on cellular repair, mitochondrial optimization, and brain performance.\n\nInside the chamber, pressure increases up to 2.0 ATA, allowing red blood cells and plasma to carry up to 1,200% more oxygen. This surge enhances cellular energy, helps reduce inflammation, may activate stem cells, and supports deep tissue healing, all key mechanisms linked to anti-aging and metabolic health.\n\nWhy HBOT is part of my longevity protocol:\n\n• Brain Health & Cognitive Performance Oxygen may drive neurogenesis, improves focus and clarity, and supports long-term brain resilience.\n• Longevity & Biological Age Markers Research shows HBOT may lengthen telomeres and reduce senescent cell burden, two biomarkers of aging.\n• Recovery & Performance It accelerates muscle and tissue repair after training, travel, stress, or immune challenges, supporting faster recovery and higher output.\n• Circulation, Healing & Detoxification More oxygen = improved nutrient delivery, better circulation, and more efficient cellular detox.\n\nI typically do 1.5–2.0 ATA for 60–90 minutes, several times per week depending on my training load, travel schedule, and cellular repair phase. I am also doing a body protocol of 40 sessions 1x per year at 2.0ATA and a brain protocol at 1.5ATA for 40 sessions per year, then maintenance in between those protocols. \n\nHBOT is a most powerful natural longevity tool, using only oxygen and pressure to enhance energy, healing, and cellular function at the deepest level.\n\nAsk me a question below if you have one, or tell me about your HBOT protocol!",

Here is what we KNOW - consistency in training for longevity and overall health is absolutely critical. Personally, I don’t deal with any PMS symptoms, so I don’t need or benefit from down regulating my training in the luteal phase. BUT if you do suffer from symptoms, it would make sense to listen to your body and down regulate your training. I personally operate off my DATA, so looking at HRV, recovery scores, and overall symptoms or lack thereof, for example, I was recently in my luteal phase and had a bunch of travel, and I was scheduled to VO2 max training, but because my recovery was low at that point I push pushed out the VO2 max training to three or four days later after I had adequate recovery. I didn’t skip the training (because if I miss half a month of training every month I won’t hit my longevity goals ) but instead, I just pushed it out until my personal recovery was better. I hope this helps. Please leave me a question below if you have them on this topic, and I’ll answer! Also a PT 2 of this is coming soon!",

Mine look like: morning prayer, then my morning walk, then either breath work or HBOT around 1 pm then using @pulsetto.tech to shift into parasympathetic at night before bed. \n2. Removed toxic people from my life (this really helps!) \n3. Started really paying attention to how much time I spend in high stress zones on my wearable. \n4. Don’t eat too close to bed (it will disrupt sleep which increases stress) \n5. Go to bed early! \n6. Ensure you get enough friend/spouse/play time \n7. Calm supplements when needed (I use cortisol manager by Integrative Therapeutics) \n\nI have significantly dropped my levels of stress from 2024 to 2025! Tell me in the comments what you’ve found to be most helpful for stress reduction! \n\n#ad #pulsettopartner",

        "caption": "So excited to have just published “The Information Theory of Aging,” 8 years after I started, and 4 years after publishing it in Lifespan 📖. \n🧬 \nThe “ITOA” states that a cause of aging is a loss of epigenetic information that disrupts the ability of cells to read the right genes, causing them to lose their identity & malfunction.\n🧬 \nThe theory stands on the shoulders of former @mit professor Claude Shannon (see my sketch for Lifespan), who formulated “The Mathematical Theory of Communication” in 1948, which led to the digital world we now live in.\n🧬 \nOver time, tissues become old & dysfunctional, manifesting as diseases, ranging from diabetes to Alzheimer’s. Reprogramming cells back to a more youthful state is possible using a combination of three Yamanaka factors (called O, S & K) or small molecules.\n🧬 \nIn some species, such as axylotls, fish and mice, epigenetic reprogramming regenerates old or damaged tissue. Humans have largely lost this ability.\n🧬 \nIf ITOA is true, it may be possible to rejuvenate organs by resetting the epigenome to prevent or cure a variety of diseases, thereby extending healthy lifespan. Human trials to reverse blindness are in the planning stages.\n🧬 \nProud of the hard work by coauthors @Y_Ryan_Lu @XiaoTianPhD. The idea for ITOA was first published in 2008 (Oberdoerffer et al, Cell), and presented in Lifespan, this unifying paper took 3 years to write and get through the review process.\n🧬 \nPhotos: \n1.

We start with adult cells (like human skin cells) and reprogram them into stem cells. These stem cells can grow into brain tissues, forming tiny 3D models in a dish then advanced imaging can be used. \n\n🔬By studying brain organoids, we can uncover new ways to protect neurons and promote lifelong brain health.

The NMJ is one of the first places to show signs of decline in age-related muscle loss and diseases like ALS. By combining imaging + function, Dr. Rich’s work helps us get one step closer to decoding the biology of aging and novel therapies for treatment of age related diseases. \n \nFollow our lab account for weekly updates and more. 👩‍🔬 Once we hit 50k followers we will do an Instagram live!

Researchers are discovering that when the balance of bacteria in your mouth shifts (what we call oral dysbiosis), it can trigger systemic inflammation, invade arterial walls and contribute to cardiovascular disease.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\n• Harmful oral bacteria and their by-products can enter the bloodstream through inflamed gums or bleeding pockets. That creates a low-level chronic inflammation which is a known driver of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). \n• Some oral bacteria have been found inside atherosclerotic plaques (the very blockages in arteries), pointing to a direct microbial infiltration. \n\n• The mechanisms are multifold: endothelial (blood‐vessel) dysfunction, platelet activation (clotting), immune cross-reactivity, and more all linking the mouth to the heart. \n\n• In fact, recent studies show that people with lower diversity in their oral microbiome have higher risk of cardiovascular mortality. \n\nSo yes your oral hygiene routine goes beyond a bright smile. It might just protect your heart too.\n\n✅ Takeaway for you: Brush, floss, clean below the gum line, see your dentist, and partner that with your whole-body longevity strategy. Because when we’re optimizing health at Longevity Place, the mouth is absolutely part of the equation.\n\n#Longevity #health #oralmicrobiome",

Let’s unpack the facts.\n\n💡 Wired headphones have no wireless signal and therefore emit essentially zero radiofrequency (RF) radiation.\n\nWireless earbuds (like AirPods) use Bluetooth, which emits non-ionizing RF radiation, the same type used in Wi-Fi and cell phones. These levels are very low (around 0.001–0.01 W), but the difference is proximity: they sit inside your ear canal, only millimeters from your brain and cranial nerves.\n\n📚 Here’s what the science shows:\n\n• A 2023 study found that long-term daily Bluetooth headset use was correlated with a higher incidence of thyroid nodules, though it did not prove causation (PMCID: PMC11192738). \n\n• A 2016 review in Electromagnetic Biology & Medicine reported that radiofrequency exposure can increase oxidative stress and DNA damage in cells, particularly with prolonged close exposure (Yakymenko et al., 2016).\n\n• The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies RF radiation as a “possible carcinogen” (Group 2B), meaning more research is needed, especially on long-term exposure close to the head.\n\nImportant to noteC AirPods are well within safety limits\n\n⚖️ So what’s the takeaway?\n\nWhile radiation levels are low, placing a transmitter directly beside your brain for hours every day is something our biology hasn’t evolved for. From a longevity and neuroprotective standpoint, it’s wise to reduce constant, close contact.\n\n#health #healthy #longevity #fyp",

A recent study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition* highlights the significant benefits of reducing sugar intake during this vital period. \n\nHere’s why cutting back on sugar is so important:\n\n1. Brain Development: Lowering sugar intake can support better brain health and cognitive function in children. A healthy diet rich in whole foods helps fuel their growing minds! 🧠✨\n\n2. Reduced Risk of Obesity:Excessive sugar consumption is linked to childhood obesity. By limiting sugar, we can help maintain a healthy weight and prevent related health issues later in life. ⚖️❤️\n\n3. Stronger Immune System: Reducing sugar can enhance the immune system, making little ones less susceptible to infections and illnesses. 🦠💪\n\n4. Better Nutrition Choices: Cutting back on sugary snacks and drinks opens up opportunities for healthier food choices that provide essential nutrients for growth and development. 🥦🍎\n\n5. Establishing Healthy Habits: Early dietary habits often stick with us for life. Teaching kids to enjoy less sugar can lead to lifelong healthy eating patterns. 🌱🥗\n\nLet’s prioritize our little ones’ health by making conscious choices about sugar intake. Every small step counts! \n\n✨ “The first 1000 days of life are a critical window for establishing healthy eating - The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition\n\n#parenting #children #sugar #toxins #babies #fyp",

        "caption": "Recovery is one of the most overlooked longevity tools. When your cells repair well, everything from energy to mobility improves. And while cold exposure and long rest days work for some people, recovery also comes down to how efficiently your mitochondria bounce back after stress.\n\nOne approach I use is targeted light therapy, which supports the biology behind repair rather than just the symptoms. Red and infrared wavelengths interact with the mitochondria inside your muscles and joints, helping them produce energy more efficiently while easing stiffness and inflammation. It is a simple way to strengthen day-to-day resilience without slowing life down.\n\nIf recovery is a priority for you this season, you can learn more about the Move+ Pro, comment RECOVERY and I will send you the link (and exclusive discount code👀).",

When that timing shifts every few days, your body’s repair processes never fully catch up.\n\nHere’s why consistency matters:\n ✅ Better sleep quality and deeper repair\n ✅ Balanced cortisol and blood sugar\n ✅ Stronger metabolism and immune function\n ✅ Lower inflammation and oxidative stress\n\nAnd if you struggle to fall asleep consistently, try these:\n🕯 Use red lights in your house 90 minutes before bed to cue melatonin\n\n 🫖 Supplement with a full spectrum Magnesium before bed (Comment MAG below for my favorite one)\n\n 📱 No screens 60 minutes before sleep — or use red light filters\n\n 🌿 Supplement with melatonin (Not all are created equal. Comment MELATONIN below for the link to the one I use)\n\n 🌞 Morning sunlight within 30 minutes of waking to anchor your circadian rhythm. Yes, how you start your day determines how well you sleep!\n\nSo remember this: The real anti-aging secret is rhythm — your body needs predictability to heal and thrive.",

That entire sequence is an evolutionary program designed to protect the system while it repairs.\n\nCells follow their own program too, and it is far more specific.\n\nWhen a cell encounters stress, it does not improvise. It shifts into one of a limited set of responses shaped by evolution. Molecular inflammation rises. Cytokines increase. Protein folding becomes unstable and triggers the unfolded protein response. Innate immunity activates. Reactive oxygen species accumulate.\n\nThis is the cellular danger response, and it is the same whether the trigger is psychological, chemical, physical, or metabolic.\n\nWhat drives it is not the stressor itself, but the metabolites inside the cell. B vitamins, minerals, toxins like mercury, antioxidant capacity, and micronutrient status all determine how strongly a cell reacts and how quickly it returns to balance.\n\nUnderstanding health at this level changes the way we think about stress, repair, aging, and resilience.\n\nEP #393: Laugh, Sweat, Detox: The Misunderstood Pathways to PEAK Health (Mitochondria, Doomscrolling, and Sex) With Dr. Ted Achacoso\n\nReply 393 and I will DM you with the link to listen. 👇",

These vesicles carry a tightly organized blend of growth factors and regenerative peptides that coordinate healing at the cellular level.\n\n• PDGF, VEGF, FGF, EGF, IGF-1 support fibroblast activity, angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix renewal. These pathways are essential for collagen architecture, microvascular support, and organized tissue repair.\n• TGF-β and other anti-inflammatory peptides help down-regulate irritation by reducing cytokine activity and stabilizing the repair environment.\n• microRNAs add a regulatory layer by influencing gene expression associated with barrier integrity, mitochondrial efficiency, and long-term structural resilience.\n\nWhen these signals arrive together, they effectively “reset” communication between damaged and healthy cells. That’s why exosomes are being studied for improvements in firmness, tone, clarity, post-procedure recovery, and overall skin longevity.\n\nYoung Goose’s Vampire Exosome Serum uses this mechanism instead of trying to override it. That’s what I appreciate most. It works with the skin’s existing biology, not against it. After using it consistently, the changes I’ve noticed—better texture, more even tone, healthier barrier—track exactly with what the science predicts.\n\nIf you want more details (and an exclusive discount code👀) comment EXOSOMES and I’ll send you a DM 👇",

These outcomes have been replicated across long-term follow-ups and remain among the most misunderstood findings in modern medicine.\n\nThe misconception that “estrogen causes breast cancer” has prevented millions of women from receiving evidence-based, individualized hormone therapy that could improve quality of life, metabolic stability, bone strength, cognitive aging, and overall healthspan. As clinicians, it is our responsibility to reinterpret outdated narratives in light of current data and ensure women receive accurate, science-driven guidance, not fear-driven messaging.\n\nThis is why informed, personalized hormone care matters.

Cardiovascular Health – The PURE Study (2018):\n This landmark study followed 177,000+ people in 50 countries and found no association between moderate egg consumption (up to 1/day) and heart disease.\n ✅ In some groups, eggs were linked to a lower risk of stroke.\nSource: Dehghan et al., The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition\n\n🧠 2. Alzheimer’s Protection – @Journal of Nutrition (2024):\n In the Rush Memory and Aging Project, older adults who consumed more than one egg per week had a 47% lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease.\n ✅ This benefit is likely due to choline, a key nutrient in eggs that supports acetylcholine production, vital for memory and cognitive resilience\nHigher choline = sharper brain.\nLower choline = higher dementia risk.\nSource: Journal of Nutrition, 2024\n\nEggs provide high-quality protein, essential fats, B vitamins, and powerful brain-supportive nutrients like choline and lutein.\n\nUp to one egg per day is safe, and potentially protective!\n\nAs we rethink nutrition through the lens of functional and longevity medicine, it’s clear eggs deserve a spot in the longevity toolbox.\n\nIn Health,\nDr. Thomas Paloschi MD \nFounder, Dr.Longevity™\nwww.drlongevity.ai\nIG: @dr.Longevity\n\n#longevity #longevitymedicine #functionalmedicine #brainhealth #hearthealth #nutritionscience #preventativehealth #healthyaging #choline #drlongevity #lifestylemedicine #cognitivehealth #precisionnutrition",

Emerging data says: not necessarily.\n\nA recent study in Nature Magazine Medicine [Nat Med 30, 1791 (2024)] highlights how chronic or excessive use of NAD+ precursors such as niacin, NR, NMN, or high-dose IV NAD+ can result in the accumulation of toxic downstream metabolites, including 2PY and 4PY.\nThese pyridone derivatives can activate VCAM-1, promote endothelial dysfunction, and are now mechanistically linked to increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular mortality in humans.\n\nThis isn’t anti-NAD+. It’s a call for precision!\n\nAs a longevity physician, I’ve long questioned the trend of unregulated NAD+ IVs or high-dose daily precursors without biomarker-guided personalization.\n\nSo what does “moderation is key” mean in evidence-based longevity?\n\n✅ Use physiological doses, guided by estimated NAD+ turnover\n 🔁 Cycle strategically, avoiding continuous, supraphysiologic exposure\n 🧬 Assess methylation status and detox capacity prior to initiation\n 🧪 Track inflammatory markers, NAD+ catabolites, and clinical response\n ❌ Avoid indiscriminate stacking of NR, NMN, Niacin, and NAD+ infusions\n\nThanks to insights from my dear colleague Elizabeth Yurth, MD, ABAARM, FAARM, FAARFM, I’ve become increasingly interested in 1-Methylnicotinamide (1-MNA), a NAD+ metabolite with vasoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and potentially anticancer effects.\n1-MNA may be a better option for NAD+ support, it acts as an NNMT blocker, helping avoid the risk of feeding senescent or cancerous cells, while also supporting endothelial and immune function.\n\nBottom line... We don’t need megadoses, we need the right molecule, at the right time, for the right patient.\n\nLongevity medicine isn’t about flooding pathways, it’s about targeted optimization, preserving resilience, and aligning interventions with biology.\n\nLet’s move past the hype,and toward data-driven, human-first longevity.\n\n#longevity #NAD #1MNA #NNMT #cardiovascularhealth #healthspan #personalizedmedicine #epigenetics #biomarkers #precisionmedicine #naturemedicine #DrLongevity #antiaging #mitochondrialhealth",

High blood pressure, high LDL, and poor glucose control quietly damage the tiny vessels that keep your brain alive, accelerating inflammation and the processes that drive dementia. The advantage is that these risks are measurable and modifiable. When you improve metabolic health through better blood pressure, lower LDL, stronger insulin sensitivity, consistent training, and stable routines, you’re actively protecting your cognitive future.",
