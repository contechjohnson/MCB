Typical Care: One quick visit with your OBGYN at 6 weeks postpartum, basic anxiety & depression screening once, general reassurance that your symptoms are ""normal.""

Comprehensive Postpartum Care: Full nutrition, inflammation, thyroid, and metabolic panels, in-depth analysis to identify deficiencies and imbalances, personalized care plans tailored to your unique needs.

Your PCP and OBGYN might tell you everything’s 'normal,' but they're not drawing the labs you actually need postpartum...so how do they know?

That fatigue, anxiety, low libido, and brain fog? It’s not in your head, and it’s not just 'new mom life.' It’s your body screaming for help.

You deserve real answers, not brushed-off symptoms.

Don’t let anyone tell you 'it’ll get better' without actually checking what's going on inside your body.

If you're tired of feeling ignored, it’s time to take control of your health.

DM me ""RELIEF"" and let’s get those labs done right. 

We’ve got your back. 💪",Postpartum Care USA,,,https://external-ord5-1.xx.fbcdn.net/emg1/v/t13/8369855397539564254?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fads%2Fimage%2F%3Fd%3DAQKzLe60sylHgAQM5zPRlrpXb7yiyBVQ-FTHaFgoA3uAjeqhLcnshW2KerFMtwGIGcK7ElXZRTAc5crCo-nwGYcwdHSeHyGNX2l-_x0n9tteCcD4ofo3gf4Rw9Rntec7Zk0DAziCt6xWYNHGAnKbs_gg&fb_obo=1&utld=facebook.com&stp=c0.5000x0.5000f_dst-emg0_p64x64_q75_tt6&edm=AAT1rw8EAAAA&_nc_gid=w0lzgyYCDErksqj42lgChA&_nc_oc=AdnhBsViDiqwm535Nv8qu68KUcscAd5D1_Ss1NJo6UKAOTzrsbs82lbwHNiMyfGs28A&ccb=13-1&oh=06_Q3-4AW8_JxjBKeX0X6v9fADU-YDv5e5a02bmo9VB2aMDbWOW&oe=68F33B6A&_nc_sid=58080a,https://business.facebook.com/ads/api/preview_iframe.php?d=AQIZ81KeA-YN5flB0hHFc3a9oUqxXcPS3MKoMdGSyyyIt3YtG41jrI0JK3vOQHmQITahnQdXjocFO8a5P0hySdKh8T2tuuEMfIguOOqoFBojOH9GlpfOwFPEXlDhx111dfOt_ORHRRMvzRFf-6Jz18ZQDg9VSkF6TPK4hHCX6HZgHWWA3o30eH7X3uJPf5y1LrtOOZ3kgamBUFuquf6cEY1TnCc6QVegsnhM-Vd5KQglEHsaKDeOmi1tioL-4ac8ovx_rbhTHJVIefqNCuE8TUGMFjGNHqBHLlmcFzK9fyS9Ued1R6PO5E6bIEBsG57tcHj_J2vVNFfIBildXZRlcdvqN0vAC3XWijMoCD_CQEec8R0LwHW-b3kJsRcndqk_leBS6bkMEgvqkzPj7FoDvlDm_99-5S61VEC-oIISfY-LnPSAqlStmGdDTAxe8Z64xFI&amp;t=AQIOywlz0pMhWvnIMJI,106901132304917_703952342605858,3008804,38355,823793,127%,$1.68,3.652379,16870,215,2228,0,16240,54385,$28.91,$299.62,168559528

After being a nurse/nurse practitioner for 13 years and helping 100’s of mamas prevent and treat postpartum depression I have learned what it takes to help a mama THRIVE postpartum.  The key? EDUCATION.   We need to educate the entire family on what to expect and how to prevent baby blues and postpartum depression.   Most mamas have prepared for their baby and for birth…  But what about preparing for beyond birth?  Even I didn't prepare the first time around. I thought I would be equipped to handle my first born and postpartum journey without support  I was so wrong!   Nothing was what I thought it would be, from labor to breastfeeding to postpartum.  Everything was SO hard!   Despite having a loving, supportive husband, I felt overwhelmed and alone.   That's when I realized postpartum care and support in our country was lacking, so I decided to change that!  After countless hours of research, podcasts, and studying international protocols, I've created a business helping mamas prevent and treat postpartum anxiety/depression.

Supplements are vital to combat postnatal depletion syndrome, but it's only one portion of the whole picture!  Mamas need high-dose supplements combined with a solid nutrition plan for at least 3-4 months to replenish what the placenta takes when delivered. Your placenta houses all your hormones and nutrients, making labs imperative to understand what exactly you are depleted in.  But, each mama is different, which is why labs are so important! This will help tell us exactly what nutrients mama needs to replace. Combine supplements, nutrition, and simple lifestyle changes, and you will have the success you need to overcome the many symptoms postpartum causes.

When you become a new mama, you may experience what's called postpartum depletion syndrome. This often involves extreme fatigue, mood swings, and difficulty concentrating, which comes from the physical strain of pregnancy, childbirth, and caring for a newborn baby.  If a new mama doesn't receive proper support or self-care, postpartum depletion syndrome can impact a mother's well-being, as well as her ability to care for herself and her baby.  This is WHY we are here. Without proper treatment, those symptoms can worsen. Not only can they lead to long-term health issues, but they can also affect her ability to bond with her baby.  Addressing postpartum depletion syndrome early can help restore energy levels, improve mood, and support overall maternal health, helping with a smoother transition into motherhood.

It’s time to get the help you NEED!

Mama, I know investing in yourself feels hard when you’re already struggling through so many side effects of postnatal depletion. 

But your kiddos need you to start advocating to get the help you need (and they deserve)…

We’ve been conditioned to believe that postpartum recovery is only 6 weeks long, when in reality – it can go on for YEARS if left untreated. 😣

How you feel today (and have felt for the last few months) doesn’t feel like the woman, mama, or wife you want to be, so how much is it costing you to just accept this as “normal”?

I can tell you…

It’s stripping you of your chance to show your tiny humans the power of self-love and resilience.

It’s forcing you to miss out on precious moments where you’re fully engaged with your family because the physical, mental, and emotional effects of postpartum bog you down. 

But here's the thing…

Healthy moms raise healthy kiddos, and healthy wives live in healthy homes. Period.

That’s why we’re creating generational health for postpartum moms.

Many of the mamas in our community start feeling better in as little as 30 days, and you deserve that, too. 

You deserve to feel strong and energetic. 

You deserve the mental clarity to focus on things you enjoy again (remember when you used to LOVE going to brunch?! 😍) 

You deserve to feel like yourself again, Mama, and my team will advocate for you all the way. 

This is a short-term investment for the long-term health benefits you, your tiny humans, and even your husband deserve. 

Let’s find out what’s really going on in your body so you can get back to your *real* normal.

But they aren’t.

That’s why you need more than a “typical” doctor visit that brushes your experience off as just “baby blues.”

You need comprehensive postpartum care that gives you expert support, full nutrition analysis, and personalized care plans tailored to what’s *actually* going on inside your body.

My husband wanted to help SO badly, but in the moment I had no idea what he could do for me.  Nothing was what I thought it would be…I’ve been a nurse practitioner for a total of 13 years, and I thought I would be equipped to handle my first born and postpartum journey.  I was so wrong!  From labor to breastfeeding to postpartum, I felt brand new. And I knew I couldn’t be the only new mom out there in need of help, but without the words to express how I needed my husband to show up.   So after going through postpartum 3x in 4 years my husband and I have created foolproof strategies on how to rock postpartum together.  This information will change you and your husband's postpartum journey into a beautiful tangle of stability and confidence.

Instead, they’ll tell you that the unwanted weight gain, irritability with your tiny human (and your husband), chronic fatigue, and low libido are all “typical” parts of your journey.   But they aren’t.  That’s why you need more than a “typical” doctor visit that brushes your experience off as just “baby blues.”  You need comprehensive postpartum care that gives you expert support, full nutrition analysis, and personalized care plans tailored to what’s *actually* going on inside your body.   Nothing about motherhood is “typical,” and your postpartum care shouldn’t be treated that way.   DM us “HEAL” so we can help you thrive in motherhood – not just survive! ||| If your postpartum labs came back “normal,” but you’re still experiencing hair loss, weight gain, irritability, or low libido, it could mean your PCP/OBGYN isn’t drawing enough tests.  The truth is…most PCPs/OBGYNs will tell you these are typical effects of giving birth because they simply aren’t equipped to look for what *actually* matters postpartum.  Hi! 👋 I’m Stacia Scott! Not only have I gone through postpartum 3 times in 4 years but…   I’m a Nurse Practitioner specializing in postpartum care. I’ve helped 2500 mamas reclaim their physical, mental, and emotional health after giving birth because I know firsthand that basic lab tests won’t cut it.  That’s why at Postpartum Care USA, we draw 55+ labs that focus on your thyroid health, nutrient deficiencies, hormonal imbalances, metabolic panels, and so much more.   You shouldn’t have to accept things like ❌weight gain, ❌chronic fatigue, ❌low libido, or ❌mom brain as your “new normal”, mama.   I want to help you get the in-depth testing you need to get to the root of these postpartum symptoms for good.  DM me “HEAL” so I can help you thrive in motherhood – not just survive! ||| Mama, your PCP/OBGYN will tell you chronic fatigue, mom brain, and low libido are “normal” after giving birth, but as postpartum experts, we’re here to tell you it’s NOT.   Every mama’s journey is unique, but after months (or even years) of feeling this way…  You *know* something just isn’t right. You *still* don’t feel like yourself, and these symptoms haven’t just “gone away” like your PCP/OBGYN promised they would. 🤔  That’s because these are all signs of Postnatal Depletion Syndrome (or PND), and not only do they affect your physical health…they can also affect your mental health, too.  But at Postpartum Care USA, we get to the root cause of these symptoms so you can get back to the root of who you are (you know…fun, vibrant, free 🤍)...

It’s time to get the help you NEED!  Mama, I know investing in yourself feels hard when you’re already struggling through so many side effects of postnatal depletion.   But your kiddos need you to start advocating to get the help you need (and they deserve)…  We’ve been conditioned to believe that postpartum recovery is only 6 weeks long, when in reality – it can go on for YEARS if left untreated. 😣  How you feel today (and have felt for the last few months) doesn’t feel like the woman, mama, or wife you want to be, so how much is it costing you to just accept this as “normal”?  I can tell you…  It’s stripping you of your chance to show your tiny humans the power of self-love and resilience.  It’s forcing you to miss out on precious moments where you’re fully engaged with your family because the physical, mental, and emotional effects of postpartum bog you down.   But here's the thing…  Healthy moms raise healthy kiddos, and healthy wives live in healthy homes. Period.  That’s why we’re creating generational health for postpartum moms.  Many of the mamas in our community start feeling better in as little as 30 days, and you deserve that, too.   You deserve to feel strong and energetic.   You deserve the mental clarity to focus on things you enjoy again (remember when you used to LOVE going to brunch?! 😍)   You deserve to feel like yourself again, Mama, and my team will advocate for you all the way.   This is a short-term investment for the long-term health benefits you, your tiny humans, and even your husband deserve.

⌛The longer you wait to get the proper care — the longer it takes for you to feel like *yourself* again. 

🛑Untreated postpartum symptoms can last up to 10 years. Trust me, Mama, you don’t want to feel this way for another 10 years. 

✖️Most PCPs/OBGYNs aren’t equipped to look for postpartum-specific symptoms beyond 6 weeks. That’s why your labs come back “normal” while you feel anything but. 

We do things differently at Postpartum Care USA. We focus on healing the root cause of your symptoms. 

We give you: 

✔️Lab reviews designed to analyze 55+ markers
✔️Personalized supplement + nutrition plans to help you achieve optimal health
✔️Real support, real conversations, and real results with postpartum experts who care

And right now, you can book your initial consultation for just $20.

No guesswork. 

No pressure. 

No generic conversations about your not-so-generic health. 

Just real answers.

Our team of postpartum experts are ready to help you reclaim your energy and your well-being.

I was informed, educated, and by all means prepared. And yet, I found myself both isolated and overwhelmed in my 4th trimester.  I have been through postpartum 3 times in the last 4 years.   I am not only a mama, I am also a nurse practitioner trained specifically to treat mama’s during this crucial postpartum period.   My very best friend Chelsea reached out to me 5 days after delivering her sweet baby boy.  She told me that her legs were swollen and her blood pressure was high. I took one look at her and told her she needed to call her OBGYN and that she would need to go to the ER immediately.  Within 12 hours of being in the ER my friend had coded, was intubated, and was sent to the ICU.   Essentially, she went into heart failure and she had less than a 20% chance of survival…   My young, healthy best friend was about to die after giving birth to her first baby boy, what???  By the grace of god, she woke up a few days later.  From that day forward, I vowed to dedicate my life to postpartum care, education, and empower mamas so this never happens to any family again.  I have researched thousands of hours of postpartum literature, listened to dozens of podcasts, and studied supplement and nutrition protocols in other countries.  I took bits and pieces from postpartum experts to create a postpartum program unlike any other.  I want to share this information with you mama!

It’s time to get the help you NEED!  Mama, I know investing in yourself feels hard when you’re already struggling through so many side effects of postnatal depletion.   But your kiddos need you to start advocating to get the help you need (and they deserve)…  We’ve been conditioned to believe that postpartum recovery is only 6 weeks long, when in reality – it can go on for YEARS if left untreated. 😣  How you feel today (and have felt for the last few months) doesn’t feel like the woman, mama, or wife you want to be, so how much is it costing you to just accept this as “normal”?  I can tell you…  It’s stripping you of your chance to show your tiny humans the power of self-love and resilience.  It’s forcing you to miss out on precious moments where you’re fully engaged with your family because the physical, mental, and emotional effects of postpartum bog you down.   But here's the thing…  Healthy moms raise healthy kiddos, and healthy wives live in healthy homes. Period.  That’s why we’re creating generational health for postpartum moms.  Many of the mamas in our community start feeling better in as little as 30 days, and you deserve that, too.   You deserve to feel strong and energetic.   You deserve the mental clarity to focus on things you enjoy again (remember when you used to LOVE going to brunch?! 😍)   You deserve to feel like yourself again, Mama, and my team will advocate for you all the way.

It’s about analyzing the signs your body is showing us and helping you find long-lasting relief with the right labs, nutrition, and targeted supplements.

I am not only a mama, I am also a nurse practitioner trained specifically to treat mama’s during this crucial postpartum period.   My very best friend Chelsea reached out to me 5 days after delivering her sweet baby boy.  She told me that her legs were swollen and her blood pressure was high. I took one look at her and told her she needed to call her OBGYN and that she would need to go to the ER immediately.  Within 12 hours of being in the ER my friend had coded, was intubated, and was sent to the ICU.   Essentially, she went into heart failure and she had less than a 20% chance of survival…   My young, healthy best friend was about to die after giving birth to her first baby boy, what???  By the grace of god, she woke up a few days later.  From that day forward, I vowed to dedicate my life to postpartum care, education, and empower mamas so this never happens to any family again.

I was informed, educated, and by all means prepared. And yet, I found myself both isolated and overwhelmed in my 4th trimester.  I have been through postpartum 3 times in the last 4 years.   I am not only a mama, I am also a nurse practitioner trained specifically to treat mama’s during this crucial postpartum period.   My very best friend Chelsea reached out to me 5 days after delivering her sweet baby boy.  She told me that her legs were swollen and her blood pressure was high. I took one look at her and told her she needed to call her OBGYN and that she would need to go to the ER immediately.  Within 12 hours of being in the ER my friend had coded, was intubated, and was sent to the ICU.   Essentially, she went into heart failure and she had less than a 20% chance of survival…   My young, healthy best friend was about to die after giving birth to her first baby boy, what???  By the grace of god, she woke up a few days later.  From that day forward, I vowed to dedicate my life to postpartum care, education, and empower mamas so this never happens to any family again.  I have researched thousands of hours of postpartum literature, listened to dozens of podcasts, and studied supplement and nutrition protocols in other countries.  I took bits and pieces from postpartum experts to create a postpartum program unlike any other.  I want to share this information with you mama!

It’s time to get the help you NEED!

Mama, I know investing in yourself feels hard when you’re already struggling through so many side effects of postnatal depletion. 

But your kiddos need you to start advocating to get the help you need (and they deserve)…

We’ve been conditioned to believe that postpartum recovery is only 6 weeks long, when in reality – it can go on for YEARS if left untreated. 😣

How you feel today (and have felt for the last few months) doesn’t feel like the woman, mama, or wife you want to be, so how much is it costing you to just accept this as “normal”?

I can tell you…

It’s stripping you of your chance to show your tiny humans the power of self-love and resilience.

It’s forcing you to miss out on precious moments where you’re fully engaged with your family because the physical, mental, and emotional effects of postpartum bog you down. 

But here's the thing…

Healthy moms raise healthy kiddos, and healthy wives live in healthy homes. Period.

That’s why we’re creating generational health for postpartum moms.

Many of the mamas in our community start feeling better in as little as 30 days, and you deserve that, too. 

You deserve to feel strong and energetic. 

You deserve the mental clarity to focus on things you enjoy again (remember when you used to LOVE going to brunch?! 😍) 

You deserve to feel like yourself again, Mama, and my team will advocate for you all the way. 

This is a short-term investment for the long-term health benefits you, your tiny humans, and even your husband deserve. 

Let’s find out what’s really going on in your body so you can get back to your *real* normal.

That’s why at Postpartum Care USA, we offer a 100% money-back guarantee. 

We know how stressful, frustrating, and even dangerous it is for your overall well-being to constantly be told by your PCP/OBGYN that what you’re experiencing postpartum is “normal.”

We also know that at this point, you’re not sure if more testing is even worth it. 

But I want to personally assure you that it is. 

“This isn’t a bandaid. Stacia and Sarah have helped me more than my OBGYN ever thought about helping. They help you heal so you can feel empowered and enjoy postpartum.” ⭐

You’re not just getting basic labs or generic care. You’re getting specialized support, expert guidance, and holistic healthcare that will change your life forever. 

♥️Postpartum-Specific Practitioners who know what imbalances to look for and how to help you heal them!

♥️Comprehensive Lab Testing that goes deeper than basic anxiety + depression and helps you analyze your symptoms at the root! 

♥️Personalized Supplement + Nutrition Plans that target optimal recovery, prioritize long-lasting health, and help you get back to yourself!

And so much more…

You shouldn’t have to accept bare-minimum postpartum care, so we tailor our services to ensure you get the whole-mama support you need – with a money-back guarantee. 

Take the first step. Click the button on this ad and book your Virtual Health Assessment today! ||| They say childbirth is dangerous, but so is depending on big pharma for your postpartum care! 🫣

Make no mistake – we LOVE our PCPs/OBGYNs…just not when it comes to *expert* postpartum care. (Sorry, not sorry 🙊)

Here’s the thing…

Your PCP/OBGYN means well when they tell you that what you’re experiencing is just part of being a mom.

But deep down, you KNOW something is off, and that Zoloft prescription isn’t doing a thing.

It’s time for you to get the care you need and the relief you deserve. 

Don’t let another PCP/OBGYN write your symptoms off as “normal.”

Instead, book a virtual health assessment with us so we can take a postpartum-specific, customized approach to helping you achieve optimal physical, mental, and emotional health.

Listen, mama, at Postpartum Care USA, we know that recovery is about more than working through anxiety and depression.

It’s about analyzing the signs your body is showing us and helping you find long-lasting relief with the right labs, nutrition, and targeted supplements. 

It’s about taking a whole-body approach to feel like the whole woman you are.

Don’t let big pharma convince you that yet another “off day” is your “new normal.”

It’s time to get the help you NEED!  Mama, I know investing in yourself feels hard when you’re already struggling through so many side effects of postnatal depletion.   But your kiddos need you to start advocating to get the help you need (and they deserve)…  We’ve been conditioned to believe that postpartum recovery is only 6 weeks long, when in reality – it can go on for YEARS if left untreated. 😣  How you feel today (and have felt for the last few months) doesn’t feel like the woman, mama, or wife you want to be, so how much is it costing you to just accept this as “normal”?  I can tell you…  It’s stripping you of your chance to show your tiny humans the power of self-love and resilience.  It’s forcing you to miss out on precious moments where you’re fully engaged with your family because the physical, mental, and emotional effects of postpartum bog you down.   But here's the thing…  Healthy moms raise healthy kiddos, and healthy wives live in healthy homes. Period.  That’s why we’re creating generational health for postpartum moms.  Many of the mamas in our community start feeling better in as little as 30 days, and you deserve that, too.   You deserve to feel strong and energetic.   You deserve the mental clarity to focus on things you enjoy again (remember when you used to LOVE going to brunch?! 😍)   You deserve to feel like yourself again, Mama, and my team will advocate for you all the way.   This is a short-term investment for the long-term health benefits you, your tiny humans, and even your husband deserve.

That’s why at Postpartum Care USA, we offer a 100% money-back guarantee.   We know how stressful, frustrating, and even dangerous it is for your overall well-being to constantly be told by your PCP/OBGYN that what you’re experiencing postpartum is “normal.”  We also know that at this point, you’re not sure if more testing is even worth it.   But I want to personally assure you that it is.   “This isn’t a bandaid. Stacia and Sarah have helped me more than my OBGYN ever thought about helping. They help you heal so you can feel empowered and enjoy postpartum.” ⭐  You’re not just getting basic labs or generic care. You’re getting specialized support, expert guidance, and holistic healthcare that will change your life forever.   ♥️Postpartum-Specific Practitioners who know what imbalances to look for and how to help you heal them!  ♥️Comprehensive Lab Testing that goes deeper than basic anxiety + depression and helps you analyze your symptoms at the root!   ♥️Personalized Supplement + Nutrition Plans that target optimal recovery, prioritize long-lasting health, and help you get back to yourself!

(Sorry, not sorry 🙊)  Here’s the thing…  Your PCP/OBGYN means well when they tell you that what you’re experiencing is just part of being a mom.  But deep down, you KNOW something is off, and that Zoloft prescription isn’t doing a thing.  It’s time for you to get the care you need and the relief you deserve.   Don’t let another PCP/OBGYN write your symptoms off as “normal.”  Instead, book a virtual health assessment with us so we can take a postpartum-specific, customized approach to helping you achieve optimal physical, mental, and emotional health.  Listen, mama, at Postpartum Care USA, we know that recovery is about more than working through anxiety and depression.  It’s about analyzing the signs your body is showing us and helping you find long-lasting relief with the right labs, nutrition, and targeted supplements.   It’s about taking a whole-body approach to feel like the whole woman you are.

After being a nurse/nurse practitioner for 13 years and helping 100’s of mamas prevent and treat postpartum depression, I have learned what it takes to help YOU THRIVE postpartum.  What's the key?  Maternal mental and physical health through EDUCATION from a postpartum expert.    We educate the entire family on what to expect and how to prepare for and significantly reduce the symptoms of baby blues and postpartum depression, and make maternal mental health a priority!  I've uncovered the secrets to thriving during postpartum and I've put them all inside my courses.     Most mamas have prepared for their baby and for birth… and we love that!  BUT what about preparing for beyond birth?  Even I didn't prepare the first time around. I thought I would be equipped to handle my first born and postpartum journey without support.  I was so wrong!   Nothing was what I thought it would be, from labor to breastfeeding to postpartum symptoms.  Everything was SO hard!   Despite having a loving, supportive husband, I felt overwhelmed, scared, and utterly alone.   That's when I realized postpartum care and support in our country was lacking, so I decided to change that!  After months and months of research, diving into the data, and studying international protocols, I've created a business helping moms prevent and treat postpartum anxiety/depression.

After being a nurse/nurse practitioner for 13 years and helping 100’s of mamas prevent and treat postpartum depression I have learned what it takes to help a mama THRIVE postpartum.  The key? EDUCATION.   We need to educate the entire family on what to expect and how to prevent baby blues and postpartum depression.   Most mamas have prepared for their baby and for birth…  But what about preparing for beyond birth?  Even I didn't prepare the first time around. I thought I would be equipped to handle my first born and postpartum journey without support  I was so wrong!   Nothing was what I thought it would be, from labor to breastfeeding to postpartum.  Everything was SO hard!   Despite having a loving, supportive husband, I felt overwhelmed and alone.   That's when I realized postpartum care and support in our country was lacking, so I decided to change that!  After countless hours of research, podcasts, and studying international protocols, I've created a business helping mamas prevent and treat postpartum anxiety/depression.  Mama, I want to share this information with you!  Beyond Birth: Baby Blues and Postpartum Depression Online Course prepares you and your family for what to expect in the first days, weeks, and months postpartum so you do not have to struggle with postpartum depression.   You deserve to have a postpartum experience that allows you and your family to thrive, connect, and enjoy this short time with your precious new baby.

I took bits and pieces from postpartum experts to create a postpartum program unlike any other.  I want to share this information with you mama!

Are you 6, 12, or even 18+ months postpartum and still experiencing mama rage, chronic fatigue, low libido, or hair loss? It’s time to get the help you NEED!

Mama, I know investing in yourself feels hard when you’re already struggling through so many side effects of postnatal depletion. 

But your kiddos need you to start advocating to get the help you need (and they deserve)…

We’ve been conditioned to believe that postpartum recovery is only 6 weeks long, when in reality – it can go on for YEARS if left untreated. 😣

How you feel today (and have felt for the last few months) doesn’t feel like the woman, mama, or wife you want to be, so how much is it costing you to just accept this as “normal”?

I can tell you…

It’s stripping you of your chance to show your tiny humans the power of self-love and resilience.

It’s forcing you to miss out on precious moments where you’re fully engaged with your family because the physical, mental, and emotional effects of postpartum bog you down. 

But here's the thing…

Healthy moms raise healthy kiddos, and healthy wives live in healthy homes. Period.

That’s why we’re creating generational health for postpartum moms.

Many of the mamas in our community start feeling better in as little as 30 days, and you deserve that, too. 

You deserve to feel strong and energetic. 

You deserve the mental clarity to focus on things you enjoy again (remember when you used to LOVE going to brunch?! 😍) 

You deserve to feel like yourself again, Mama, and my team will advocate for you all the way. 

This is a short-term investment for the long-term health benefits you, your tiny humans, and even your husband deserve. 

Let’s find out what’s really going on in your body so you can get back to your *real* normal.

That’s why at Postpartum Care USA, we offer a 100% money-back guarantee. 

We know how stressful, frustrating, and even dangerous it is for your overall well-being to constantly be told by your PCP/OBGYN that what you’re experiencing postpartum is “normal.”

We also know that at this point, you’re not sure if more testing is even worth it. 

But I want to personally assure you that it is.

They say childbirth is dangerous, but so is depending on big pharma for your postpartum care! 🫣

Make no mistake – we LOVE our PCPs/OBGYNs…just not when it comes to *expert* postpartum care. (Sorry, not sorry 🙊)

Here’s the thing…

Your PCP/OBGYN means well when they tell you that what you’re experiencing is just part of being a mom.

But deep down, you KNOW something is off, and that Zoloft prescription isn’t doing a thing.

It’s time for you to get the care you need and the relief you deserve. 

Don’t let another PCP/OBGYN write your symptoms off as “normal.”

Instead, book a virtual health assessment with us so we can take a postpartum-specific, customized approach to helping you achieve optimal physical, mental, and emotional health.

Listen, mama, at Postpartum Care USA, we know that recovery is about more than working through anxiety and depression.

It’s about analyzing the signs your body is showing us and helping you find long-lasting relief with the right labs, nutrition, and targeted supplements. 

It’s about taking a whole-body approach to feel like the whole woman you are.

Don’t let big pharma convince you that yet another “off day” is your “new normal.”

It’s forcing you to miss out on precious moments where you’re fully engaged with your family because the physical, mental, and emotional effects of postpartum bog you down.   But here's the thing…  Healthy moms raise healthy kiddos, and healthy wives live in healthy homes. Period.  That’s why we’re creating generational health for postpartum moms.  Many of the mamas in our community start feeling better in as little as 30 days, and you deserve that, too.   You deserve to feel strong and energetic.

Click the button on this ad and book your Virtual Health Assessment today! ||| They say childbirth is dangerous, but so is depending on big pharma for your postpartum care! 🫣  Make no mistake – we LOVE our PCPs/OBGYNs…just not when it comes to *expert* postpartum care. (Sorry, not sorry 🙊)  Here’s the thing…  Your PCP/OBGYN means well when they tell you that what you’re experiencing is just part of being a mom.  But deep down, you KNOW something is off, and that Zoloft prescription isn’t doing a thing.  It’s time for you to get the care you need and the relief you deserve.   Don’t let another PCP/OBGYN write your symptoms off as “normal.”  Instead, book a virtual health assessment with us so we can take a postpartum-specific, customized approach to helping you achieve optimal physical, mental, and emotional health.  Listen, mama, at Postpartum Care USA, we know that recovery is about more than working through anxiety and depression.  It’s about analyzing the signs your body is showing us and helping you find long-lasting relief with the right labs, nutrition, and targeted supplements.   It’s about taking a whole-body approach to feel like the whole woman you are.  Don’t let big pharma convince you that yet another “off day” is your “new normal.”  Book your virtual assessment and start your journey to better health for the rest of your life.

It’s time to get the help you NEED!  Mama, I know investing in yourself feels hard when you’re already struggling through so many side effects of postnatal depletion.   But your kiddos need you to start advocating to get the help you need (and they deserve)…  We’ve been conditioned to believe that postpartum recovery is only 6 weeks long, when in reality – it can go on for YEARS if left untreated. 😣  How you feel today (and have felt for the last few months) doesn’t feel like the woman, mama, or wife you want to be, so how much is it costing you to just accept this as “normal”?  I can tell you…  It’s stripping you of your chance to show your tiny humans the power of self-love and resilience.  It’s forcing you to miss out on precious moments where you’re fully engaged with your family because the physical, mental, and emotional effects of postpartum bog you down.   But here's the thing…  Healthy moms raise healthy kiddos, and healthy wives live in healthy homes. Period.  That’s why we’re creating generational health for postpartum moms.  Many of the mamas in our community start feeling better in as little as 30 days, and you deserve that, too.   You deserve to feel strong and energetic.   You deserve the mental clarity to focus on things you enjoy again (remember when you used to LOVE going to brunch?! 😍)   You deserve to feel like yourself again, Mama, and my team will advocate for you all the way.   This is a short-term investment for the long-term health benefits you, your tiny humans, and even your husband deserve.

The truth is…most PCPs/OBGYNs will tell you these are typical effects of giving birth because they simply aren’t equipped to look for what *actually* matters postpartum.  Hi! 👋 I’m Stacia Scott! Not only have I gone through postpartum 3 times in 4 years but…   I’m a Nurse Practitioner specializing in postpartum care. I’ve helped 2500 mamas reclaim their physical, mental, and emotional health after giving birth because I know firsthand that basic lab tests won’t cut it.  That’s why at Postpartum Care USA, we draw 55+ labs that focus on your thyroid health, nutrient deficiencies, hormonal imbalances, metabolic panels, and so much more.   You shouldn’t have to accept things like ❌weight gain, ❌chronic fatigue, ❌low libido, or ❌mom brain as your “new normal”, mama.

Listen, Mama, as a mom who has experienced postpartum three times in four years and a Nurse Practitioner who specializes in postpartum care…  I know without doubt that what you’re feeling isn’t “normal” and it's certainly not just “in your head.”  Your body is screaming for more support.

It’s time to get the help you NEED!  Mama, I know investing in yourself feels hard when you’re already struggling through so many side effects of postnatal depletion.   But your kiddos need you to start advocating to get the help you need (and they deserve)…  We’ve been conditioned to believe that postpartum recovery is only 6 weeks long, when in reality – it can go on for YEARS if left untreated. 😣  How you feel today (and have felt for the last few months) doesn’t feel like the woman, mama, or wife you want to be, so how much is it costing you to just accept this as “normal”?  I can tell you…  It’s stripping you of your chance to show your tiny humans the power of self-love and resilience.  It’s forcing you to miss out on precious moments where you’re fully engaged with your family because the physical, mental, and emotional effects of postpartum bog you down.   But here's the thing…  Healthy moms raise healthy kiddos, and healthy wives live in healthy homes. Period.  That’s why we’re creating generational health for postpartum moms.  Many of the mamas in our community start feeling better in as little as 30 days, and you deserve that, too.   You deserve to feel strong and energetic.   You deserve the mental clarity to focus on things you enjoy again (remember when you used to LOVE going to brunch?! 😍)   You deserve to feel like yourself again, Mama, and my team will advocate for you all the way.   This is a short-term investment for the long-term health benefits you, your tiny humans, and even your husband deserve.

After being a nurse/nurse practitioner for 13 years and helping 100’s of mamas prevent and treat postpartum depression I have learned what it takes to help a mama THRIVE postpartum.  The key? EDUCATION.   We need to educate the entire family on what to expect and how to prevent baby blues and postpartum depression.   Most mamas have prepared for their baby and for birth…  But what about preparing for beyond birth?  Even I didn't prepare the first time around.

Everything was SO hard!   Despite having a loving, supportive husband, I felt overwhelmed and alone.   That's when I realized postpartum care and support in our country was lacking, so I decided to change that!

It’s time to get the help you NEED!  Mama, I know investing in yourself feels hard when you’re already struggling through so many side effects of postnatal depletion.   But your kiddos need you to start advocating to get the help you need (and they deserve)…  We’ve been conditioned to believe that postpartum recovery is only 6 weeks long, when in reality – it can go on for YEARS if left untreated. 😣  How you feel today (and have felt for the last few months) doesn’t feel like the woman, mama, or wife you want to be, so how much is it costing you to just accept this as “normal”?  I can tell you…  It’s stripping you of your chance to show your tiny humans the power of self-love and resilience.  It’s forcing you to miss out on precious moments where you’re fully engaged with your family because the physical, mental, and emotional effects of postpartum bog you down.   But here's the thing…  Healthy moms raise healthy kiddos, and healthy wives live in healthy homes. Period.  That’s why we’re creating generational health for postpartum moms.  Many of the mamas in our community start feeling better in as little as 30 days, and you deserve that, too.   You deserve to feel strong and energetic.   You deserve the mental clarity to focus on things you enjoy again (remember when you used to LOVE going to brunch?! 😍)   You deserve to feel like yourself again, Mama, and my team will advocate for you all the way.   This is a short-term investment for the long-term health benefits you, your tiny humans, and even your husband deserve.

I was so wrong!   Nothing was what I thought it would be, from labor to breastfeeding to postpartum.  Everything was SO hard!   Even though I have a loving, present, and supportive husband, I was overwhelmed and quickly felt alone and uncertain about everything.   I then realized postpartum care and support in our country was severely lacking, so I decided to change that!  I have researched thousands of hours of postpartum literature, listened to dozens of podcasts, and studied supplement and nutrition protocols in other countries.  I took bits and pieces from postpartum experts to create a postpartum program unlike any other.  I want to share this information with you mama!

After being a nurse/nurse practitioner for 13 years and helping 100’s of mamas prevent and treat postpartum depression I have learned what it takes to help a mama THRIVE postpartum.  The key? EDUCATION.   We need to educate the entire family on what to expect and how to prevent baby blues and postpartum depression.   Most mamas have prepared for their baby and for birth…  But what about preparing for beyond birth?  Even I didn't prepare the first time around. I thought I would be equipped to handle my first born and postpartum journey without support  I was so wrong!   Nothing was what I thought it would be, from labor to breastfeeding to postpartum.  Everything was SO hard!   Despite having a loving, supportive husband, I felt overwhelmed and alone.   That's when I realized postpartum care and support in our country was lacking, so I decided to change that!  After countless hours of research, podcasts, and studying international protocols, I've created a business helping mamas prevent and treat postpartum anxiety/depression.  Mama, I want to share this information with you!  Beyond Birth: Baby Blues and Postpartum Depression Online Course prepares you and your family for what to expect in the first days, weeks, and months postpartum so you do not have to struggle with postpartum depression.   You deserve to have a postpartum experience that allows you and your family to thrive, connect, and enjoy this short time with your precious new baby.

You need THIS 👇  After being a nurse/nurse practitioner for 13 years and helping 100’s of mamas prevent and treat postpartum depression I have learned what it takes to help a mama THRIVE postpartum.  The key? EDUCATION.   We need to educate the entire family on what to expect and how to prevent baby blues and postpartum depression.   Most mamas have prepared for their baby and for birth…  But what about preparing for beyond birth?  Even I didn't prepare the first time around. I thought I would be equipped to handle my first born and postpartum journey without support  I was so wrong!   Nothing was what I thought it would be, from labor to breastfeeding to postpartum.  Everything was SO hard!   Despite having a loving, supportive husband, I felt overwhelmed and alone.   That's when I realized postpartum care and support in our country was lacking, so I decided to change that!  After countless hours of research, podcasts, and studying international protocols, I've created a business helping mamas prevent and treat postpartum anxiety/depression.  Mama, I want to share this information with you!  Beyond Birth: Baby Blues and Postpartum Depression Online Course prepares you and your family for what to expect in the first days, weeks, and months postpartum so you do not have to struggle with postpartum depression.   You deserve to have a postpartum experience that allows you and your family to thrive, connect, and enjoy this short time with your precious new baby.

It’s time to get the help you NEED!

Mama, I know investing in yourself feels hard when you’re already struggling through so many side effects of postnatal depletion. 

But your kiddos need you to start advocating to get the help you need (and they deserve)…

We’ve been conditioned to believe that postpartum recovery is only 6 weeks long, when in reality – it can go on for YEARS if left untreated. 😣

How you feel today (and have felt for the last few months) doesn’t feel like the woman, mama, or wife you want to be, so how much is it costing you to just accept this as “normal”?

I can tell you…

It’s stripping you of your chance to show your tiny humans the power of self-love and resilience.

It’s forcing you to miss out on precious moments where you’re fully engaged with your family because the physical, mental, and emotional effects of postpartum bog you down. 

But here's the thing…

Healthy moms raise healthy kiddos, and healthy wives live in healthy homes. Period.

That’s why we’re creating generational health for postpartum moms.

Many of the mamas in our community start feeling better in as little as 30 days, and you deserve that, too. 

You deserve to feel strong and energetic. 

You deserve the mental clarity to focus on things you enjoy again (remember when you used to LOVE going to brunch?! 😍) 

You deserve to feel like yourself again, Mama, and my team will advocate for you all the way. 

This is a short-term investment for the long-term health benefits you, your tiny humans, and even your husband deserve.

I was informed, educated, and by all means prepared. And yet, I found myself both isolated and overwhelmed in my 4th trimester.  I have been through postpartum 3 times in the last 4 years.   I am not only a mama, I am also a nurse practitioner trained specifically to treat mama’s during this crucial postpartum period.   My very best friend Chelsea reached out to me 5 days after delivering her sweet baby boy.  She told me that her legs were swollen and her blood pressure was high. I took one look at her and told her she needed to call her OBGYN and that she would need to go to the ER immediately.  Within 12 hours of being in the ER my friend had coded, was intubated, and was sent to the ICU.   Essentially, she went into heart failure and she had less than a 20% chance of survival…   My young, healthy best friend was about to die after giving birth to her first baby boy, what???  By the grace of god, she woke up a few days later.  From that day forward, I vowed to dedicate my life to postpartum care, education, and empower mamas so this never happens to any family again.  I have researched thousands of hours of postpartum literature, listened to dozens of podcasts, and studied supplement and nutrition protocols in other countries.  I took bits and pieces from postpartum experts to create a postpartum program unlike any other.  I want to share this information with you mama!

Postpartum? It's a rollercoaster for everyone. No, seriously! 🎢  Did you know?  ⚠️1 in 10 men experience postpartum depression and anxiety issues?  ⚠️ If you have postpartum anxiety or depression that your spouse is 50% more likely to experience it themselves?  ⚠️  80% of spouses said that they were not prepared for postpartum, how to help, how to support their significant other, and how to communicate to their wives?

Parenthood? Not a one-person gig. You gotta be a team, on the same page, for the win. 🙌  Education is your power move, and most dads have no clue what to expect when it comes to postpartum.

After being a nurse/nurse practitioner for 13 years and helping 100’s of mamas prevent and treat postpartum depression, I have learned what it takes to help YOU THRIVE postpartum.  What's the key?  Maternal mental and physical health through EDUCATION from a postpartum expert.    We educate the entire family on what to expect and how to prepare for and significantly reduce the symptoms of baby blues and postpartum depression, and make maternal mental health a priority!  I've uncovered the secrets to thriving during postpartum and I've put them all inside my courses.     Most mamas have prepared for their baby and for birth… and we love that!  BUT what about preparing for beyond birth?  Even I didn't prepare the first time around. I thought I would be equipped to handle my first born and postpartum journey without support.  I was so wrong!   Nothing was what I thought it would be, from labor to breastfeeding to postpartum symptoms.  Everything was SO hard!   Despite having a loving, supportive husband, I felt overwhelmed, scared, and utterly alone.   That's when I realized postpartum care and support in our country was lacking, so I decided to change that!  After months and months of research, diving into the data, and studying international protocols, I've created a business helping moms prevent and treat postpartum anxiety/depression.

Are you 6, 12, or even 18+ months postpartum and still experiencing mama rage, chronic fatigue, low libido, or hair loss? It’s time to get the help you NEED!  Mama, I know investing in yourself feels hard when you’re already struggling through so many side effects of postnatal depletion.   But your kiddos need you to start advocating to get the help you need (and they deserve)…  We’ve been conditioned to believe that postpartum recovery is only 6 weeks long, when in reality – it can go on for YEARS if left untreated. 😣  How you feel today (and have felt for the last few months) doesn’t feel like the woman, mama, or wife you want to be, so how much is it costing you to just accept this as “normal”?  I can tell you…  It’s stripping you of your chance to show your tiny humans the power of self-love and resilience.  It’s forcing you to miss out on precious moments where you’re fully engaged with your family because the physical, mental, and emotional effects of postpartum bog you down.   But here's the thing…  Healthy moms raise healthy kiddos, and healthy wives live in healthy homes. Period.  That’s why we’re creating generational health for postpartum moms.  Many of the mamas in our community start feeling better in as little as 30 days, and you deserve that, too.   You deserve to feel strong and energetic.   You deserve the mental clarity to focus on things you enjoy again (remember when you used to LOVE going to brunch?! 😍)   You deserve to feel like yourself again, Mama, and my team will advocate for you all the way.   This is a short-term investment for the long-term health benefits you, your tiny humans, and even your husband deserve.

How you feel today (and have felt for the last few months) doesn’t feel like the woman, mama, or wife you want to be, so how much is it costing you to just accept this as “normal”?

I can tell you…

It’s stripping you of your chance to show your tiny humans the power of self-love and resilience.

It’s forcing you to miss out on precious moments where you’re fully engaged with your family because the physical, mental, and emotional effects of postpartum bog you down. 

But here's the thing…

Healthy moms raise healthy kiddos, and healthy wives live in healthy homes. Period.

That’s why we’re creating generational health for postpartum moms.

Many of the mamas in our community start feeling better in as little as 30 days, and you deserve that, too. 

You deserve to feel strong and energetic. 

You deserve the mental clarity to focus on things you enjoy again (remember when you used to LOVE going to brunch?! 😍) 

You deserve to feel like yourself again, Mama, and my team will advocate for you all the way. 

This is a short-term investment for the long-term health benefits you, your tiny humans, and even your husband deserve. 

Let’s find out what’s really going on in your body so you can get back to your *real* normal.

I’ve helped 2500 mamas reclaim their physical, mental, and emotional health after giving birth because I know firsthand that basic lab tests won’t cut it.  That’s why at Postpartum Care USA, we draw 55+ labs that focus on your thyroid health, nutrient deficiencies, hormonal imbalances, metabolic panels, and so much more.   You shouldn’t have to accept things like ❌weight gain, ❌chronic fatigue, ❌low libido, or ❌mom brain as your “new normal”, mama.   I want to help you get the in-depth testing you need to get to the root of these postpartum symptoms for good.  DM me “55” so we can get you the relief you (and your baby) deserve. ❤️",Postpartum Care USA,"NEWSFLASH: ONE quick visit + basic lab testing with your PCP/OBGYN 6 weeks after childbirth hardly qualifies as postpartum care…but they won’t tell you that.   Instead, they’ll tell you that the unwanted weight gain, irritability with your tiny human (and your husband), chronic fatigue, and low libido are all “typical” parts of your journey.   But they aren’t.  That’s why you need more than a “typical” doctor visit that brushes your experience off as just “baby blues.”  You need comprehensive postpartum care that gives you expert support, full nutrition analysis, and personalized care plans tailored to what’s *actually* going on inside your body.   Nothing about motherhood is “typical,” and your postpartum care shouldn’t be treated that way.

I was informed, educated, and by all means prepared. And yet, I found myself both isolated and overwhelmed in my 4th trimester.  I have been through postpartum 3 times in the last 4 years.   I am not only a mama, I am also a nurse practitioner trained specifically to treat mama’s during this crucial postpartum period.   My very best friend Chelsea reached out to me 5 days after delivering her sweet baby boy.  She told me that her legs were swollen and her blood pressure was high. I took one look at her and told her she needed to call her OBGYN and that she would need to go to the ER immediately.  Within 12 hours of being in the ER my friend had coded, was intubated, and was sent to the ICU.   Essentially, she went into heart failure and she had less than a 20% chance of survival…   My young, healthy best friend was about to die after giving birth to her first baby boy, what???  By the grace of god, she woke up a few days later.  From that day forward, I vowed to dedicate my life to postpartum care, education, and empower mamas so this never happens to any family again.  I have researched thousands of hours of postpartum literature, listened to dozens of podcasts, and studied supplement and nutrition protocols in other countries.  I took bits and pieces from postpartum experts to create a postpartum program unlike any other.  I want to share this information with you mama!

Not only have I gone through postpartum 3 times in 4 years but…   I’m a Nurse Practitioner specializing in postpartum care. I’ve helped 2500 mamas reclaim their physical, mental, and emotional health after giving birth because I know firsthand that basic lab tests won’t cut it.  That’s why at Postpartum Care USA, we draw 55+ labs that focus on your thyroid health, nutrient deficiencies, hormonal imbalances, metabolic panels, and so much more.   You shouldn’t have to accept things like ❌weight gain, ❌chronic fatigue, ❌low libido, or ❌mom brain as your “new normal”, mama.   I want to help you get the in-depth testing you need to get to the root of these postpartum symptoms for good.

After being a nurse/nurse practitioner for 13 years and helping 100’s of mamas prevent and treat postpartum depression I have learned what it takes to help a mama THRIVE postpartum.  The key? EDUCATION.   We need to educate the entire family on what to expect and how to prevent baby blues and postpartum depression.   Most mamas have prepared for their baby and for birth…  But what about preparing for beyond birth?  Even I didn't prepare the first time around. I thought I would be equipped to handle my first born and postpartum journey without support  I was so wrong!   Nothing was what I thought it would be, from labor to breastfeeding to postpartum.  Everything was SO hard!   Despite having a loving, supportive husband, I felt overwhelmed and alone.   That's when I realized postpartum care and support in our country was lacking, so I decided to change that!  After countless hours of research, podcasts, and studying international protocols, I've created a business helping mamas prevent and treat postpartum anxiety/depression.  Mama, I want to share this information with you!  Beyond Birth: Baby Blues and Postpartum Depression Online Course prepares you and your family for what to expect in the first days, weeks, and months postpartum so you do not have to struggle with postpartum depression.   You deserve to have a postpartum experience that allows you and your family to thrive, connect, and enjoy this short time with your precious new baby.

It’s time to get the help you NEED!  Mama, I know investing in yourself feels hard when you’re already struggling through so many side effects of postnatal depletion.   But your kiddos need you to start advocating to get the help you need (and they deserve)…  We’ve been conditioned to believe that postpartum recovery is only 6 weeks long, when in reality – it can go on for YEARS if left untreated. 😣  How you feel today (and have felt for the last few months) doesn’t feel like the woman, mama, or wife you want to be, so how much is it costing you to just accept this as “normal”?  I can tell you…  It’s stripping you of your chance to show your tiny humans the power of self-love and resilience.  It’s forcing you to miss out on precious moments where you’re fully engaged with your family because the physical, mental, and emotional effects of postpartum bog you down.   But here's the thing…  Healthy moms raise healthy kiddos, and healthy wives live in healthy homes. Period.  That’s why we’re creating generational health for postpartum moms.  Many of the mamas in our community start feeling better in as little as 30 days, and you deserve that, too.   You deserve to feel strong and energetic.   You deserve the mental clarity to focus on things you enjoy again (remember when you used to LOVE going to brunch?! 😍)   You deserve to feel like yourself again, Mama, and my team will advocate for you all the way.   This is a short-term investment for the long-term health benefits you, your tiny humans, and even your husband deserve.

After being a nurse/nurse practitioner for 13 years and helping 100’s of mamas prevent and treat postpartum depression I have learned what it takes to help a mama THRIVE postpartum.  The key? EDUCATION.   We need to educate the entire family on what to expect and how to prevent baby blues and postpartum depression.   Most mamas have prepared for their baby and for birth…  But what about preparing for beyond birth?  Even I didn't prepare the first time around. I thought I would be equipped to handle my first born and postpartum journey without support  I was so wrong!   Nothing was what I thought it would be, from labor to breastfeeding to postpartum.  Everything was SO hard!   Despite having a loving, supportive husband, I felt overwhelmed and alone.   That's when I realized postpartum care and support in our country was lacking, so I decided to change that!  After countless hours of research, podcasts, and studying international protocols, I've created a business helping mamas prevent and treat postpartum anxiety/depression.

It’s time to get the help you NEED!  Mama, I know investing in yourself feels hard when you’re already struggling through so many side effects of postnatal depletion.   But your kiddos need you to start advocating to get the help you need (and they deserve)…  We’ve been conditioned to believe that postpartum recovery is only 6 weeks long, when in reality – it can go on for YEARS if left untreated. 😣  How you feel today (and have felt for the last few months) doesn’t feel like the woman, mama, or wife you want to be, so how much is it costing you to just accept this as “normal”?  I can tell you…  It’s stripping you of your chance to show your tiny humans the power of self-love and resilience.  It’s forcing you to miss out on precious moments where you’re fully engaged with your family because the physical, mental, and emotional effects of postpartum bog you down.   But here's the thing…  Healthy moms raise healthy kiddos, and healthy wives live in healthy homes. Period.  That’s why we’re creating generational health for postpartum moms.  Many of the mamas in our community start feeling better in as little as 30 days, and you deserve that, too.   You deserve to feel strong and energetic.   You deserve the mental clarity to focus on things you enjoy again (remember when you used to LOVE going to brunch?! 😍)   You deserve to feel like yourself again, Mama, and my team will advocate for you all the way.   This is a short-term investment for the long-term health benefits you, your tiny humans, and even your husband deserve.

That’s why at Postpartum Care USA, we offer a 100% money-back guarantee.   We know how stressful, frustrating, and even dangerous it is for your overall well-being to constantly be told by your PCP/OBGYN that what you’re experiencing postpartum is “normal.”  We also know that at this point, you’re not sure if more testing is even worth it.   But I want to personally assure you that it is.   “This isn’t a bandaid. Stacia and Sarah have helped me more than my OBGYN ever thought about helping. They help you heal so you can feel empowered and enjoy postpartum.” ⭐  You’re not just getting basic labs or generic care. You’re getting specialized support, expert guidance, and holistic healthcare that will change your life forever.   ♥️Postpartum-Specific Practitioners who know what imbalances to look for and how to help you heal them!  ♥️Comprehensive Lab Testing that goes deeper than basic anxiety + depression and helps you analyze your symptoms at the root!   ♥️Personalized Supplement + Nutrition Plans that target optimal recovery, prioritize long-lasting health, and help you get back to yourself!

(Sorry, not sorry 🙊)  Here’s the thing…  Your PCP/OBGYN means well when they tell you that what you’re experiencing is just part of being a mom.  But deep down, you KNOW something is off, and that Zoloft prescription isn’t doing a thing.  It’s time for you to get the care you need and the relief you deserve.   Don’t let another PCP/OBGYN write your symptoms off as “normal.”  Instead, book a virtual health assessment with us so we can take a postpartum-specific, customized approach to helping you achieve optimal physical, mental, and emotional health.  Listen, mama, at Postpartum Care USA, we know that recovery is about more than working through anxiety and depression.  It’s about analyzing the signs your body is showing us and helping you find long-lasting relief with the right labs, nutrition, and targeted supplements.   It’s about taking a whole-body approach to feel like the whole woman you are.

After being a nurse/nurse practitioner for 13 years and helping 100’s of mamas prevent and treat postpartum depression I have learned what it takes to help a mama THRIVE postpartum.  The key? EDUCATION.   We need to educate the entire family on what to expect and how to prevent baby blues and postpartum depression.   Most mamas have prepared for their baby and for birth…  But what about preparing for beyond birth?  Even I didn't prepare the first time around. I thought I would be equipped to handle my first born and postpartum journey without support  I was so wrong!   Nothing was what I thought it would be, from labor to breastfeeding to postpartum.  Everything was SO hard!   Despite having a loving, supportive husband, I felt overwhelmed and alone.   That's when I realized postpartum care and support in our country was lacking, so I decided to change that!  After countless hours of research, podcasts, and studying international protocols, I've created a business helping mamas prevent and treat postpartum anxiety/depression.  Mama, I want to share this information with you!  Beyond Birth: Baby Blues and Postpartum Depression Online Course prepares you and your family for what to expect in the first days, weeks, and months postpartum so you do not have to struggle with postpartum depression.   You deserve to have a postpartum experience that allows you and your family to thrive, connect, and enjoy this short time with your precious new baby.

When you become a new mama, you may experience what's called postpartum depletion syndrome. This often involves extreme fatigue, mood swings, and difficulty concentrating, which comes from the physical strain of pregnancy, childbirth, and caring for a newborn baby.  If a new mama doesn't receive proper support or self-care, postpartum depletion syndrome can impact a mother's well-being, as well as her ability to care for herself and her baby.

It’s time to get the help you NEED!  Mama, I know investing in yourself feels hard when you’re already struggling through so many side effects of postnatal depletion.   But your kiddos need you to start advocating to get the help you need (and they deserve)…  We’ve been conditioned to believe that postpartum recovery is only 6 weeks long, when in reality – it can go on for YEARS if left untreated. 😣  How you feel today (and have felt for the last few months) doesn’t feel like the woman, mama, or wife you want to be, so how much is it costing you to just accept this as “normal”?  I can tell you…  It’s stripping you of your chance to show your tiny humans the power of self-love and resilience.  It’s forcing you to miss out on precious moments where you’re fully engaged with your family because the physical, mental, and emotional effects of postpartum bog you down.   But here's the thing…  Healthy moms raise healthy kiddos, and healthy wives live in healthy homes. Period.  That’s why we’re creating generational health for postpartum moms.  Many of the mamas in our community start feeling better in as little as 30 days, and you deserve that, too.   You deserve to feel strong and energetic.   You deserve the mental clarity to focus on things you enjoy again (remember when you used to LOVE going to brunch?! 😍)   You deserve to feel like yourself again, Mama, and my team will advocate for you all the way.

It’s time to get the help you NEED!  Mama, I know investing in yourself feels hard when you’re already struggling through so many side effects of postnatal depletion.   But your kiddos need you to start advocating to get the help you need (and they deserve)…  We’ve been conditioned to believe that postpartum recovery is only 6 weeks long, when in reality – it can go on for YEARS if left untreated. 😣  How you feel today (and have felt for the last few months) doesn’t feel like the woman, mama, or wife you want to be, so how much is it costing you to just accept this as “normal”?  I can tell you…  It’s stripping you of your chance to show your tiny humans the power of self-love and resilience.  It’s forcing you to miss out on precious moments where you’re fully engaged with your family because the physical, mental, and emotional effects of postpartum bog you down.   But here's the thing…  Healthy moms raise healthy kiddos, and healthy wives live in healthy homes. Period.  That’s why we’re creating generational health for postpartum moms.  Many of the mamas in our community start feeling better in as little as 30 days, and you deserve that, too.   You deserve to feel strong and energetic.   You deserve the mental clarity to focus on things you enjoy again (remember when you used to LOVE going to brunch?! 😍)   You deserve to feel like yourself again, Mama, and my team will advocate for you all the way.   This is a short-term investment for the long-term health benefits you, your tiny humans, and even your husband deserve.

After being a nurse/nurse practitioner for 13 years and helping 100’s of mamas prevent and treat postpartum depression I have learned what it takes to help a mama THRIVE postpartum.  The key? EDUCATION.   We need to educate the entire family on what to expect and how to prevent baby blues and postpartum depression.   Most mamas have prepared for their baby and for birth…  But what about preparing for beyond birth?  Even I didn't prepare the first time around. I thought I would be equipped to handle my first born and postpartum journey without support  I was so wrong!   Nothing was what I thought it would be, from labor to breastfeeding to postpartum.  Everything was SO hard!   Despite having a loving, supportive husband, I felt overwhelmed and alone.   That's when I realized postpartum care and support in our country was lacking, so I decided to change that!  After countless hours of research, podcasts, and studying international protocols, I've created a business helping mamas prevent and treat postpartum anxiety/depression.  Mama, I want to share this information with you!

Instead, they’ll tell you that the unwanted weight gain, irritability with your tiny human (and your husband), chronic fatigue, and low libido are all “typical” parts of your journey.   But they aren’t.

DM us “HEAL” so we can help you thrive in motherhood – not just survive! ||| If your postpartum labs came back “normal,” but you’re still experiencing hair loss, weight gain, irritability, or low libido, it could mean your PCP/OBGYN isn’t drawing enough tests.

It’s time to get the help you NEED!  Mama, I know investing in yourself feels hard when you’re already struggling through so many side effects of postnatal depletion.   But your kiddos need you to start advocating to get the help you need (and they deserve)…  We’ve been conditioned to believe that postpartum recovery is only 6 weeks long, when in reality – it can go on for YEARS if left untreated. 😣  How you feel today (and have felt for the last few months) doesn’t feel like the woman, mama, or wife you want to be, so how much is it costing you to just accept this as “normal”?  I can tell you…  It’s stripping you of your chance to show your tiny humans the power of self-love and resilience.  It’s forcing you to miss out on precious moments where you’re fully engaged with your family because the physical, mental, and emotional effects of postpartum bog you down.   But here's the thing…  Healthy moms raise healthy kiddos, and healthy wives live in healthy homes. Period.  That’s why we’re creating generational health for postpartum moms.  Many of the mamas in our community start feeling better in as little as 30 days, and you deserve that, too.   You deserve to feel strong and energetic.   You deserve the mental clarity to focus on things you enjoy again (remember when you used to LOVE going to brunch?! 😍)   You deserve to feel like yourself again, Mama, and my team will advocate for you all the way.   This is a short-term investment for the long-term health benefits you, your tiny humans, and even your husband deserve.

(Sorry, not sorry 🙊)  Here’s the thing…  Your PCP/OBGYN means well when they tell you that what you’re experiencing is just part of being a mom.  But deep down, you KNOW something is off, and that Zoloft prescription isn’t doing a thing.  It’s time for you to get the care you need and the relief you deserve.   Don’t let another PCP/OBGYN write your symptoms off as “normal.”  Instead, book a virtual health assessment with us so we can take a postpartum-specific, customized approach to helping you achieve optimal physical, mental, and emotional health.  Listen, mama, at Postpartum Care USA, we know that recovery is about more than working through anxiety and depression.  It’s about analyzing the signs your body is showing us and helping you find long-lasting relief with the right labs, nutrition, and targeted supplements.

It’s time to get the help you NEED!  Mama, I know investing in yourself feels hard when you’re already struggling through so many side effects of postnatal depletion.   But your kiddos need you to start advocating to get the help you need (and they deserve)…  We’ve been conditioned to believe that postpartum recovery is only 6 weeks long, when in reality – it can go on for YEARS if left untreated. 😣  How you feel today (and have felt for the last few months) doesn’t feel like the woman, mama, or wife you want to be, so how much is it costing you to just accept this as “normal”?  I can tell you…  It’s stripping you of your chance to show your tiny humans the power of self-love and resilience.  It’s forcing you to miss out on precious moments where you’re fully engaged with your family because the physical, mental, and emotional effects of postpartum bog you down.   But here's the thing…  Healthy moms raise healthy kiddos, and healthy wives live in healthy homes. Period.  That’s why we’re creating generational health for postpartum moms.  Many of the mamas in our community start feeling better in as little as 30 days, and you deserve that, too.   You deserve to feel strong and energetic.   You deserve the mental clarity to focus on things you enjoy again (remember when you used to LOVE going to brunch?! 😍)   You deserve to feel like yourself again, Mama, and my team will advocate for you all the way.   This is a short-term investment for the long-term health benefits you, your tiny humans, and even your husband deserve.

It’s time to get the help you NEED!  Mama, I know investing in yourself feels hard when you’re already struggling through so many side effects of postnatal depletion.   But your kiddos need you to start advocating to get the help you need (and they deserve)…  We’ve been conditioned to believe that postpartum recovery is only 6 weeks long, when in reality – it can go on for YEARS if left untreated. 😣  How you feel today (and have felt for the last few months) doesn’t feel like the woman, mama, or wife you want to be, so how much is it costing you to just accept this as “normal”?  I can tell you…  It’s stripping you of your chance to show your tiny humans the power of self-love and resilience.  It’s forcing you to miss out on precious moments where you’re fully engaged with your family because the physical, mental, and emotional effects of postpartum bog you down.   But here's the thing…  Healthy moms raise healthy kiddos, and healthy wives live in healthy homes. Period.  That’s why we’re creating generational health for postpartum moms.  Many of the mamas in our community start feeling better in as little as 30 days, and you deserve that, too.   You deserve to feel strong and energetic.   You deserve the mental clarity to focus on things you enjoy again (remember when you used to LOVE going to brunch?! 😍)   You deserve to feel like yourself again, Mama, and my team will advocate for you all the way.   This is a short-term investment for the long-term health benefits you, your tiny humans, and even your husband deserve.

That’s why at Postpartum Care USA, we offer a 100% money-back guarantee.   We know how stressful, frustrating, and even dangerous it is for your overall well-being to constantly be told by your PCP/OBGYN that what you’re experiencing postpartum is “normal.”  We also know that at this point, you’re not sure if more testing is even worth it.   But I want to personally assure you that it is.   “This isn’t a bandaid. Stacia and Sarah have helped me more than my OBGYN ever thought about helping. They help you heal so you can feel empowered and enjoy postpartum.” ⭐  You’re not just getting basic labs or generic care. You’re getting specialized support, expert guidance, and holistic healthcare that will change your life forever.   ♥️Postpartum-Specific Practitioners who know what imbalances to look for and how to help you heal them!  ♥️Comprehensive Lab Testing that goes deeper than basic anxiety + depression and helps you analyze your symptoms at the root!   ♥️Personalized Supplement + Nutrition Plans that target optimal recovery, prioritize long-lasting health, and help you get back to yourself!

But deep down, you KNOW something is off, and that Zoloft prescription isn’t doing a thing.  It’s time for you to get the care you need and the relief you deserve.   Don’t let another PCP/OBGYN write your symptoms off as “normal.”  Instead, book a virtual health assessment with us so we can take a postpartum-specific, customized approach to helping you achieve optimal physical, mental, and emotional health.  Listen, mama, at Postpartum Care USA, we know that recovery is about more than working through anxiety and depression.  It’s about analyzing the signs your body is showing us and helping you find long-lasting relief with the right labs, nutrition, and targeted supplements.   It’s about taking a whole-body approach to feel like the whole woman you are.

Mama, I know investing in yourself feels hard when you’re already struggling through so many side effects of postnatal depletion. 

But your kiddos need you to start advocating to get the help you need (and they deserve)…

We’ve been conditioned to believe that postpartum recovery is only 6 weeks long, when in reality – it can go on for YEARS if left untreated. 😣

How you feel today (and have felt for the last few months) doesn’t feel like the woman, mama, or wife you want to be, so how much is it costing you to just accept this as “normal”?

I can tell you…

It’s stripping you of your chance to show your tiny humans the power of self-love and resilience.

It’s forcing you to miss out on precious moments where you’re fully engaged with your family because the physical, mental, and emotional effects of postpartum bog you down. 

But here's the thing…

Healthy moms raise healthy kiddos, and healthy wives live in healthy homes. Period.

That’s why we’re creating generational health for postpartum moms.

Many of the mamas in our community start feeling better in as little as 30 days, and you deserve that, too. 

You deserve to feel strong and energetic. 

You deserve the mental clarity to focus on things you enjoy again (remember when you used to LOVE going to brunch?! 😍) 

You deserve to feel like yourself again, Mama, and my team will advocate for you all the way. 

This is a short-term investment for the long-term health benefits you, your tiny humans, and even your husband deserve. 

Let’s find out what’s really going on in your body so you can get back to your *real* normal.

That’s why at Postpartum Care USA, we offer a 100% money-back guarantee. 

We know how stressful, frustrating, and even dangerous it is for your overall well-being to constantly be told by your PCP/OBGYN that what you’re experiencing postpartum is “normal.”

We also know that at this point, you’re not sure if more testing is even worth it. 

But I want to personally assure you that it is. 

“This isn’t a bandaid. Stacia and Sarah have helped me more than my OBGYN ever thought about helping. They help you heal so you can feel empowered and enjoy postpartum.” ⭐

You’re not just getting basic labs or generic care. You’re getting specialized support, expert guidance, and holistic healthcare that will change your life forever. 

♥️Postpartum-Specific Practitioners who know what imbalances to look for and how to help you heal them!

♥️Comprehensive Lab Testing that goes deeper than basic anxiety + depression and helps you analyze your symptoms at the root! 

♥️Personalized Supplement + Nutrition Plans that target optimal recovery, prioritize long-lasting health, and help you get back to yourself!

And so much more…

You shouldn’t have to accept bare-minimum postpartum care, so we tailor our services to ensure you get the whole-mama support you need – with a money-back guarantee. 

Take the first step. Click the button on this ad and book your Virtual Health Assessment today! ||| They say childbirth is dangerous, but so is depending on big pharma for your postpartum care! 🫣

Make no mistake – we LOVE our PCPs/OBGYNs…just not when it comes to *expert* postpartum care. (Sorry, not sorry 🙊)

Here’s the thing…

Your PCP/OBGYN means well when they tell you that what you’re experiencing is just part of being a mom.

But deep down, you KNOW something is off, and that Zoloft prescription isn’t doing a thing.

It’s time for you to get the care you need and the relief you deserve. 

Don’t let another PCP/OBGYN write your symptoms off as “normal.”

Instead, book a virtual health assessment with us so we can take a postpartum-specific, customized approach to helping you achieve optimal physical, mental, and emotional health.

Listen, mama, at Postpartum Care USA, we know that recovery is about more than working through anxiety and depression.

It’s about analyzing the signs your body is showing us and helping you find long-lasting relief with the right labs, nutrition, and targeted supplements. 

It’s about taking a whole-body approach to feel like the whole woman you are.

Don’t let big pharma convince you that yet another “off day” is your “new normal.”

It’s time to get the help you NEED!  Mama, I know investing in yourself feels hard when you’re already struggling through so many side effects of postnatal depletion.   But your kiddos need you to start advocating to get the help you need (and they deserve)…  We’ve been conditioned to believe that postpartum recovery is only 6 weeks long, when in reality – it can go on for YEARS if left untreated. 😣  How you feel today (and have felt for the last few months) doesn’t feel like the woman, mama, or wife you want to be, so how much is it costing you to just accept this as “normal”?  I can tell you…  It’s stripping you of your chance to show your tiny humans the power of self-love and resilience.  It’s forcing you to miss out on precious moments where you’re fully engaged with your family because the physical, mental, and emotional effects of postpartum bog you down.   But here's the thing…  Healthy moms raise healthy kiddos, and healthy wives live in healthy homes. Period.  That’s why we’re creating generational health for postpartum moms.  Many of the mamas in our community start feeling better in as little as 30 days, and you deserve that, too.   You deserve to feel strong and energetic.   You deserve the mental clarity to focus on things you enjoy again (remember when you used to LOVE going to brunch?! 😍)   You deserve to feel like yourself again, Mama, and my team will advocate for you all the way.   This is a short-term investment for the long-term health benefits you, your tiny humans, and even your husband deserve.

After being a nurse/nurse practitioner for 13 years and helping 100’s of mamas prevent and treat postpartum depression I have learned what it takes to help a mama THRIVE postpartum.  The key? EDUCATION.   We need to educate the entire family on what to expect and how to prevent baby blues and postpartum depression.   Most mamas have prepared for their baby and for birth…  But what about preparing for beyond birth?  Even I didn't prepare the first time around. I thought I would be equipped to handle my first born and postpartum journey without support  I was so wrong!   Nothing was what I thought it would be, from labor to breastfeeding to postpartum.  Everything was SO hard!   Despite having a loving, supportive husband, I felt overwhelmed and alone.   That's when I realized postpartum care and support in our country was lacking, so I decided to change that!  After countless hours of research, podcasts, and studying international protocols, I've created a business helping mamas prevent and treat postpartum anxiety/depression.  Mama, I want to share this information with you!  Beyond Birth: Baby Blues and Postpartum Depression Online Course prepares you and your family for what to expect in the first days, weeks, and months postpartum so you do not have to struggle with postpartum depression.

After being a nurse/nurse practitioner for 13 years and helping 100’s of mamas prevent and treat postpartum depression I have learned what it takes to help a mama THRIVE postpartum.  The key? EDUCATION.   We need to educate the entire family on what to expect and how to prevent baby blues and postpartum depression.   Most mamas have prepared for their baby and for birth…  But what about preparing for beyond birth?  Even I didn't prepare the first time around. I thought I would be equipped to handle my first born and postpartum journey without support  I was so wrong!   Nothing was what I thought it would be, from labor to breastfeeding to postpartum.  Everything was SO hard!   Despite having a loving, supportive husband, I felt overwhelmed and alone.   That's when I realized postpartum care and support in our country was lacking, so I decided to change that!  After countless hours of research, podcasts, and studying international protocols, I've created a business helping mamas prevent and treat postpartum anxiety/depression.  Mama, I want to share this information with you!  Beyond Birth: Baby Blues and Postpartum Depression Online Course prepares you and your family for what to expect in the first days, weeks, and months postpartum so you do not have to struggle with postpartum depression.   You deserve to have a postpartum experience that allows you and your family to thrive, connect, and enjoy this short time with your precious new baby.

You *know* something just isn’t right. You *still* don’t feel like yourself, and these symptoms haven’t just “gone away” like your PCP/OBGYN promised they would. 🤔

That’s because these are all signs of Postnatal Depletion Syndrome (or PND), and not only do they affect your physical health…they can also affect your mental health, too.

Your OB says your labs are “normal.”

Friends say, “That’s just mom life.”

But you know better.

Because normal doesn’t feel like:

😩 Fatigue that doesn’t lift no matter how much coffee you drink.
😶‍🌫️ Brain fog so heavy you forget words mid-sentence.
💔 Libido that never came back.

Here’s the problem: most OBs only test 5–7 markers.

We test 55+.

And in over 3,300 women we’ve helped, here’s what we’ve seen:

🔎 91% had nutrient deficiencies
🔎 73% had thyroid issues
🔎 58% had inflammation that got ignored

That’s why your labs came back “fine” while you feel anything but.

You know how infuriating it is.

Mama, it’s not normal. And it’s definitely not in your head.

These are nutrient, thyroid, and inflammation issues hiding in the labs your OB never ran.

We’ve tested over 3,300 women, and the data is clear:

✅ 91% had nutrient deficiencies
✅ 73% had thyroid issues
✅ 58% had inflammation missed on basic labs

You think it’s all happening because you’re not doing enough. Not eating right. Not working out. Not disciplined.

The truth is: these symptoms are likely from nutrient depletion. ‼️

After birth, your body goes through the most nutrient-depleting event it will ever experience.

Out of 3,300 + women we tested, 91% had nutrient deficiencies.

Which means… it’s real, trackable, AND fixable! 💛

The truth is…most PCPs/OBGYNs will tell you these are typical effects of giving birth because they simply aren’t equipped to look for what *actually* matters postpartum.  Hi! 👋 I’m Stacia Scott! Not only have I gone through postpartum 3 times in 4 years but…   I’m a Nurse Practitioner specializing in postpartum care. I’ve helped 2500 mamas reclaim their physical, mental, and emotional health after giving birth because I know firsthand that basic lab tests won’t cut it.  That’s why at Postpartum Care USA, we draw 55+ labs that focus on your thyroid health, nutrient deficiencies, hormonal imbalances, metabolic panels, and so much more.   You shouldn’t have to accept things like ❌weight gain, ❌chronic fatigue, ❌low libido, or ❌mom brain as your “new normal”, mama.   I want to help you get the in-depth testing you need to get to the root of these postpartum symptoms for good.

After being a nurse/nurse practitioner for 13 years and helping 100’s of mamas prevent and treat postpartum depression I have learned what it takes to help a mama THRIVE postpartum.  The key? EDUCATION.   We need to educate the entire family on what to expect and how to prevent baby blues and postpartum depression.   Most mamas have prepared for their baby and for birth…  But what about preparing for beyond birth?  Even I didn't prepare the first time around. I thought I would be equipped to handle my first born and postpartum journey without support  I was so wrong!   Nothing was what I thought it would be, from labor to breastfeeding to postpartum.  Everything was SO hard!   Despite having a loving, supportive husband, I felt overwhelmed and alone.   That's when I realized postpartum care and support in our country was lacking, so I decided to change that!  After countless hours of research, podcasts, and studying international protocols, I've created a business helping mamas prevent and treat postpartum anxiety/depression.

It’s time to get the help you NEED!  Mama, I know investing in yourself feels hard when you’re already struggling through so many side effects of postnatal depletion.   But your kiddos need you to start advocating to get the help you need (and they deserve)…  We’ve been conditioned to believe that postpartum recovery is only 6 weeks long, when in reality – it can go on for YEARS if left untreated. 😣  How you feel today (and have felt for the last few months) doesn’t feel like the woman, mama, or wife you want to be, so how much is it costing you to just accept this as “normal”?  I can tell you…  It’s stripping you of your chance to show your tiny humans the power of self-love and resilience.  It’s forcing you to miss out on precious moments where you’re fully engaged with your family because the physical, mental, and emotional effects of postpartum bog you down.   But here's the thing…  Healthy moms raise healthy kiddos, and healthy wives live in healthy homes. Period.  That’s why we’re creating generational health for postpartum moms.  Many of the mamas in our community start feeling better in as little as 30 days, and you deserve that, too.   You deserve to feel strong and energetic.   You deserve the mental clarity to focus on things you enjoy again (remember when you used to LOVE going to brunch?! 😍)   You deserve to feel like yourself again, Mama, and my team will advocate for you all the way.   This is a short-term investment for the long-term health benefits you, your tiny humans, and even your husband deserve.

But deep down, you KNOW something is off, and that Zoloft prescription isn’t doing a thing.  It’s time for you to get the care you need and the relief you deserve.

After being a nurse/nurse practitioner for 13 years and helping 100’s of mamas prevent and treat postpartum depression I have learned what it takes to help a mama THRIVE postpartum.  The key? EDUCATION.   We need to educate the entire family on what to expect and how to prevent baby blues and postpartum depression.   Most mamas have prepared for their baby and for birth…  But what about preparing for beyond birth?  Even I didn't prepare the first time around. I thought I would be equipped to handle my first born and postpartum journey without support  I was so wrong!   Nothing was what I thought it would be, from labor to breastfeeding to postpartum.  Everything was SO hard!   Despite having a loving, supportive husband, I felt overwhelmed and alone.   That's when I realized postpartum care and support in our country was lacking, so I decided to change that!  After countless hours of research, podcasts, and studying international protocols, I've created a business helping mamas prevent and treat postpartum anxiety/depression.  Mama, I want to share this information with you!  Beyond Birth: Baby Blues and Postpartum Depression Online Course prepares you and your family for what to expect in the first days, weeks, and months postpartum so you do not have to struggle with postpartum depression.   You deserve to have a postpartum experience that allows you and your family to thrive, connect, and enjoy this short time with your precious new baby.

I want to help you get the in-depth testing you need to get to the root of these postpartum symptoms for good.

After being a nurse/nurse practitioner for 13 years and helping 100’s of mamas prevent and treat postpartum depression, I have learned what it takes to help YOU THRIVE postpartum.  What's the key?  Maternal mental and physical health through EDUCATION from a postpartum expert.    We educate the entire family on what to expect and how to prepare for and significantly reduce the symptoms of baby blues and postpartum depression, and make maternal mental health a priority!  I've uncovered the secrets to thriving during postpartum and I've put them all inside my courses.     Most mamas have prepared for their baby and for birth… and we love that!  BUT what about preparing for beyond birth?  Even I didn't prepare the first time around. I thought I would be equipped to handle my first born and postpartum journey without support.  I was so wrong!   Nothing was what I thought it would be, from labor to breastfeeding to postpartum symptoms.  Everything was SO hard!   Despite having a loving, supportive husband, I felt overwhelmed, scared, and utterly alone.   That's when I realized postpartum care and support in our country was lacking, so I decided to change that!  After months and months of research, diving into the data, and studying international protocols, I've created a business helping moms prevent and treat postpartum anxiety/depression.  Mama, I want to share this information with you!  Beyond Birth: Baby Blues and Postpartum Depression Online Course prepares you and your family for what to expect in the first days, weeks, and months postpartum, so you do not have to struggle with postpartum depression, anxiety or that feeling of being alone.

After being a nurse/nurse practitioner for 13 years and helping 100’s of mamas prevent and treat postpartum depression I have learned what it takes to help a mama THRIVE postpartum.  The key? EDUCATION.   We need to educate the entire family on what to expect and how to prevent baby blues and postpartum depression.   Most mamas have prepared for their baby and for birth…  But what about preparing for beyond birth?  Even I didn't prepare the first time around. I thought I would be equipped to handle my first born and postpartum journey without support  I was so wrong!   Nothing was what I thought it would be, from labor to breastfeeding to postpartum.  Everything was SO hard!   Despite having a loving, supportive husband, I felt overwhelmed and alone.   That's when I realized postpartum care and support in our country was lacking, so I decided to change that!  After countless hours of research, podcasts, and studying international protocols, I've created a business helping mamas prevent and treat postpartum anxiety/depression.  Mama, I want to share this information with you!

You need THIS 👇  After being a nurse/nurse practitioner for 13 years and helping 100’s of mamas prevent and treat postpartum depression I have learned what it takes to help a mama THRIVE postpartum.  The key? EDUCATION.   We need to educate the entire family on what to expect and how to prevent baby blues and postpartum depression.   Most mamas have prepared for their baby and for birth…  But what about preparing for beyond birth?  Even I didn't prepare the first time around. I thought I would be equipped to handle my first born and postpartum journey without support  I was so wrong!   Nothing was what I thought it would be, from labor to breastfeeding to postpartum.  Everything was SO hard!   Despite having a loving, supportive husband, I felt overwhelmed and alone.   That's when I realized postpartum care and support in our country was lacking, so I decided to change that!  After countless hours of research, podcasts, and studying international protocols, I've created a business helping mamas prevent and treat postpartum anxiety/depression.  Mama, I want to share this information with you!  Beyond Birth: Baby Blues and Postpartum Depression Online Course prepares you and your family for what to expect in the first days, weeks, and months postpartum so you do not have to struggle with postpartum depression.   You deserve to have a postpartum experience that allows you and your family to thrive, connect, and enjoy this short time with your precious new baby.

After being a nurse/nurse practitioner for 13 years and helping 100’s of mamas prevent and treat postpartum depression I have learned what it takes to help a mama THRIVE postpartum.  The key? EDUCATION.   We need to educate the entire family on what to expect and how to prevent baby blues and postpartum depression.   Most mamas have prepared for their baby and for birth…  But what about preparing for beyond birth?  Even I didn't prepare the first time around. I thought I would be equipped to handle my first born and postpartum journey without support  I was so wrong!   Nothing was what I thought it would be, from labor to breastfeeding to postpartum.  Everything was SO hard!   Despite having a loving, supportive husband, I felt overwhelmed and alone.   That's when I realized postpartum care and support in our country was lacking, so I decided to change that!  After countless hours of research, podcasts, and studying international protocols, I've created a business helping mamas prevent and treat postpartum anxiety/depression.  Mama, I want to share this information with you!  Beyond Birth: Baby Blues and Postpartum Depression Online Course prepares you and your family for what to expect in the first days, weeks, and months postpartum so you do not have to struggle with postpartum depression.   You deserve to have a postpartum experience that allows you and your family to thrive, connect, and enjoy this short time with your precious new baby.

Most mamas have prepared for their baby and for birth…  But what about preparing for beyond birth?  Even I didn't prepare the first time around. I thought I would be equipped to handle my first born and postpartum journey without support  I was so wrong!   Nothing was what I thought it would be, from labor to breastfeeding to postpartum.  Everything was SO hard!   Despite having a loving, supportive husband, I felt overwhelmed and alone.   That's when I realized postpartum care and support in our country was lacking, so I decided to change that!  After countless hours of research, podcasts, and studying international protocols, I've created a business helping mamas prevent and treat postpartum anxiety/depression.  Mama, I want to share this information with you!  Beyond Birth: Baby Blues and Postpartum Depression Online Course prepares you and your family for what to expect in the first days, weeks, and months postpartum so you do not have to struggle with postpartum depression.   You deserve to have a postpartum experience that allows you and your family to thrive, connect, and enjoy this short time with your precious new baby.

After being a nurse/nurse practitioner for 13 years and helping 100’s of mamas prevent and treat postpartum depression I have learned what it takes to help a mama THRIVE postpartum.  The key? EDUCATION.   We need to educate the entire family on what to expect and how to prevent baby blues and postpartum depression.   Most mamas have prepared for their baby and for birth…  But what about preparing for beyond birth?  Even I didn't prepare the first time around. I thought I would be equipped to handle my first born and postpartum journey without support  I was so wrong!   Nothing was what I thought it would be, from labor to breastfeeding to postpartum.  Everything was SO hard!   Despite having a loving, supportive husband, I felt overwhelmed and alone.   That's when I realized postpartum care and support in our country was lacking, so I decided to change that!  After countless hours of research, podcasts, and studying international protocols, I've created a business helping mamas prevent and treat postpartum anxiety/depression.  Mama, I want to share this information with you!  Beyond Birth: Baby Blues and Postpartum Depression Online Course prepares you and your family for what to expect in the first days, weeks, and months postpartum so you do not have to struggle with postpartum depression.   You deserve to have a postpartum experience that allows you and your family to thrive, connect, and enjoy this short time with your precious new baby.

Supplements are vital to combat postnatal depletion syndrome, but it's only one portion of the whole picture!  Mamas need high-dose supplements combined with a solid nutrition plan for at least 3-4 months to replenish what the placenta takes when delivered. Your placenta houses all your hormones and nutrients, making labs imperative to understand what exactly you are depleted in.  But, each mama is different, which is why labs are so important! This will help tell us exactly what nutrients mama needs to replace. Combine supplements, nutrition, and simple lifestyle changes, and you will have the success you need to overcome the many symptoms postpartum causes.

The key? EDUCATION.   We need to educate the entire family on what to expect and how to prevent baby blues and postpartum depression.   Most mamas have prepared for their baby and for birth…  But what about preparing for beyond birth?  Even I didn't prepare the first time around. I thought I would be equipped to handle my first born and postpartum journey without support  I was so wrong!   Nothing was what I thought it would be, from labor to breastfeeding to postpartum.  Everything was SO hard!   Despite having a loving, supportive husband, I felt overwhelmed and alone.   That's when I realized postpartum care and support in our country was lacking, so I decided to change that!  After countless hours of research, podcasts, and studying international protocols, I've created a business helping mamas prevent and treat postpartum anxiety/depression.

That’s why at Postpartum Care USA, we draw 55+ labs that focus on your thyroid health, nutrient deficiencies, hormonal imbalances, metabolic panels, and so much more.

Are you 6, 12, or even 18+ months postpartum and still experiencing mama rage, chronic fatigue, low libido, or hair loss? It’s time to get the help you NEED!  Mama, I know investing in yourself feels hard when you’re already struggling through so many side effects of postnatal depletion.   But your kiddos need you to start advocating to get the help you need (and they deserve)…  We’ve been conditioned to believe that postpartum recovery is only 6 weeks long, when in reality – it can go on for YEARS if left untreated. 😣  How you feel today (and have felt for the last few months) doesn’t feel like the woman, mama, or wife you want to be, so how much is it costing you to just accept this as “normal”?  I can tell you…  It’s stripping you of your chance to show your tiny humans the power of self-love and resilience.  It’s forcing you to miss out on precious moments where you’re fully engaged with your family because the physical, mental, and emotional effects of postpartum bog you down.   But here's the thing…  Healthy moms raise healthy kiddos, and healthy wives live in healthy homes. Period.  That’s why we’re creating generational health for postpartum moms.  Many of the mamas in our community start feeling better in as little as 30 days, and you deserve that, too.   You deserve to feel strong and energetic.   You deserve the mental clarity to focus on things you enjoy again (remember when you used to LOVE going to brunch?! 😍)   You deserve to feel like yourself again, Mama, and my team will advocate for you all the way.   This is a short-term investment for the long-term health benefits you, your tiny humans, and even your husband deserve.

Listen, mama, at Postpartum Care USA, we know that recovery is about more than working through anxiety and depression.  It’s about analyzing the signs your body is showing us and helping you find long-lasting relief with the right labs, nutrition, and targeted supplements.   It’s about taking a whole-body approach to feel like the whole woman you are.

It’s time to get the help you NEED!  Mama, I know investing in yourself feels hard when you’re already struggling through so many side effects of postnatal depletion.   But your kiddos need you to start advocating to get the help you need (and they deserve)…  We’ve been conditioned to believe that postpartum recovery is only 6 weeks long, when in reality – it can go on for YEARS if left untreated. 😣  How you feel today (and have felt for the last few months) doesn’t feel like the woman, mama, or wife you want to be, so how much is it costing you to just accept this as “normal”?  I can tell you…  It’s stripping you of your chance to show your tiny humans the power of self-love and resilience.  It’s forcing you to miss out on precious moments where you’re fully engaged with your family because the physical, mental, and emotional effects of postpartum bog you down.   But here's the thing…  Healthy moms raise healthy kiddos, and healthy wives live in healthy homes. Period.  That’s why we’re creating generational health for postpartum moms.  Many of the mamas in our community start feeling better in as little as 30 days, and you deserve that, too.   You deserve to feel strong and energetic.   You deserve the mental clarity to focus on things you enjoy again (remember when you used to LOVE going to brunch?! 😍)   You deserve to feel like yourself again, Mama, and my team will advocate for you all the way.   This is a short-term investment for the long-term health benefits you, your tiny humans, and even your husband deserve.

You know how infuriating it is.

Mama, it’s not normal. And it’s definitely not in your head.

These are nutrient, thyroid, and inflammation issues hiding in the labs your OB never ran.

We’ve tested over 3,300 women, and the data is clear:

✅ 91% had nutrient deficiencies
✅ 73% had thyroid issues
✅ 58% had inflammation missed on basic labs

Your OB says your labs are “normal.”

Friends say, “That’s just mom life.”

But you know better.

Because normal doesn’t feel like:

😩 Fatigue that doesn’t lift no matter how much coffee you drink.
😶‍🌫️ Brain fog so heavy you forget words mid-sentence.
💔 Libido that never came back.

Here’s the problem: most OBs only test 5–7 markers.

We test 55+.

And in over 3,300 women we’ve helped, here’s what we’ve seen:

🔎 91% had nutrient deficiencies
🔎 73% had thyroid issues
🔎 58% had inflammation that got ignored

That’s why your labs came back “fine” while you feel anything but.

It’s time to get the help you NEED!

Mama, I know investing in yourself feels hard when you’re already struggling through so many side effects of postnatal depletion. 

But your kiddos need you to start advocating to get the help you need (and they deserve)…

We’ve been conditioned to believe that postpartum recovery is only 6 weeks long, when in reality – it can go on for YEARS if left untreated. 😣

How you feel today (and have felt for the last few months) doesn’t feel like the woman, mama, or wife you want to be, so how much is it costing you to just accept this as “normal”?

I can tell you…

It’s stripping you of your chance to show your tiny humans the power of self-love and resilience.

It’s forcing you to miss out on precious moments where you’re fully engaged with your family because the physical, mental, and emotional effects of postpartum bog you down. 

But here's the thing…

Healthy moms raise healthy kiddos, and healthy wives live in healthy homes. Period.

That’s why we’re creating generational health for postpartum moms.

Many of the mamas in our community start feeling better in as little as 30 days, and you deserve that, too. 

You deserve to feel strong and energetic. 

You deserve the mental clarity to focus on things you enjoy again (remember when you used to LOVE going to brunch?! 😍) 

You deserve to feel like yourself again, Mama, and my team will advocate for you all the way. 

This is a short-term investment for the long-term health benefits you, your tiny humans, and even your husband deserve.

Instead, they’ll tell you that the unwanted weight gain, irritability with your tiny human (and your husband), chronic fatigue, and low libido are all “typical” parts of your journey.   But they aren’t.  That’s why you need more than a “typical” doctor visit that brushes your experience off as just “baby blues.”  You need comprehensive postpartum care that gives you expert support, full nutrition analysis, and personalized care plans tailored to what’s *actually* going on inside your body.   Nothing about motherhood is “typical,” and your postpartum care shouldn’t be treated that way.   DM us “HEAL” so we can help you thrive in motherhood – not just survive! ||| If your postpartum labs came back “normal,” but you’re still experiencing hair loss, weight gain, irritability, or low libido, it could mean your PCP/OBGYN isn’t drawing enough tests.  The truth is…most PCPs/OBGYNs will tell you these are typical effects of giving birth because they simply aren’t equipped to look for what *actually* matters postpartum.  Hi! 👋 I’m Stacia Scott! Not only have I gone through postpartum 3 times in 4 years but…   I’m a Nurse Practitioner specializing in postpartum care. I’ve helped 2500 mamas reclaim their physical, mental, and emotional health after giving birth because I know firsthand that basic lab tests won’t cut it.  That’s why at Postpartum Care USA, we draw 55+ labs that focus on your thyroid health, nutrient deficiencies, hormonal imbalances, metabolic panels, and so much more.   You shouldn’t have to accept things like ❌weight gain, ❌chronic fatigue, ❌low libido, or ❌mom brain as your “new normal”, mama.   I want to help you get the in-depth testing you need to get to the root of these postpartum symptoms for good.

✅ 91% had nutrient deficiencies

Your OB says your labs are “normal.”

Friends say, “That’s just mom life.”

But you know better.

Because normal doesn’t feel like:

😩 Fatigue that doesn’t lift no matter how much coffee you drink.
😶‍🌫️ Brain fog so heavy you forget words mid-sentence.
💔 Libido that never came back.

Here’s the problem: most OBs only test 5–7 markers.

We test 55+.

And in over 3,300 women we’ve helped, here’s what we’ve seen:

🔎 91% had nutrient deficiencies
🔎 73% had thyroid issues
🔎 58% had inflammation that got ignored

That’s why your labs came back “fine” while you feel anything but.

I am not only a mama, I am also a nurse practitioner trained specifically to treat mama’s during this crucial postpartum period.   My very best friend Chelsea reached out to me 5 days after delivering her sweet baby boy.  She told me that her legs were swollen and her blood pressure was high. I took one look at her and told her she needed to call her OBGYN and that she would need to go to the ER immediately.  Within 12 hours of being in the ER my friend had coded, was intubated, and was sent to the ICU.   Essentially, she went into heart failure and she had less than a 20% chance of survival…   My young, healthy best friend was about to die after giving birth to her first baby boy, what???  By the grace of god, she woke up a few days later.  From that day forward, I vowed to dedicate my life to postpartum care, education, and empower mamas so this never happens to any family again.  I have researched thousands of hours of postpartum literature, listened to dozens of podcasts, and studied supplement and nutrition protocols in other countries.  I took bits and pieces from postpartum experts to create a postpartum program unlike any other.  I want to share this information with you mama!

It’s time to get the help you NEED!  Mama, I know investing in yourself feels hard when you’re already struggling through so many side effects of postnatal depletion.   But your kiddos need you to start advocating to get the help you need (and they deserve)…  We’ve been conditioned to believe that postpartum recovery is only 6 weeks long, when in reality – it can go on for YEARS if left untreated. 😣  How you feel today (and have felt for the last few months) doesn’t feel like the woman, mama, or wife you want to be, so how much is it costing you to just accept this as “normal”?  I can tell you…  It’s stripping you of your chance to show your tiny humans the power of self-love and resilience.  It’s forcing you to miss out on precious moments where you’re fully engaged with your family because the physical, mental, and emotional effects of postpartum bog you down.   But here's the thing…  Healthy moms raise healthy kiddos, and healthy wives live in healthy homes. Period.  That’s why we’re creating generational health for postpartum moms.  Many of the mamas in our community start feeling better in as little as 30 days, and you deserve that, too.   You deserve to feel strong and energetic.   You deserve the mental clarity to focus on things you enjoy again (remember when you used to LOVE going to brunch?! 😍)   You deserve to feel like yourself again, Mama, and my team will advocate for you all the way.   This is a short-term investment for the long-term health benefits you, your tiny humans, and even your husband deserve.

That’s why at Postpartum Care USA, we offer a 100% money-back guarantee.   We know how stressful, frustrating, and even dangerous it is for your overall well-being to constantly be told by your PCP/OBGYN that what you’re experiencing postpartum is “normal.”  We also know that at this point, you’re not sure if more testing is even worth it.   But I want to personally assure you that it is.   “This isn’t a bandaid. Stacia and Sarah have helped me more than my OBGYN ever thought about helping. They help you heal so you can feel empowered and enjoy postpartum.” ⭐  You’re not just getting basic labs or generic care. You’re getting specialized support, expert guidance, and holistic healthcare that will change your life forever.   ♥️Postpartum-Specific Practitioners who know what imbalances to look for and how to help you heal them!  ♥️Comprehensive Lab Testing that goes deeper than basic anxiety + depression and helps you analyze your symptoms at the root!   ♥️Personalized Supplement + Nutrition Plans that target optimal recovery, prioritize long-lasting health, and help you get back to yourself!

(Sorry, not sorry 🙊)  Here’s the thing…  Your PCP/OBGYN means well when they tell you that what you’re experiencing is just part of being a mom.  But deep down, you KNOW something is off, and that Zoloft prescription isn’t doing a thing.  It’s time for you to get the care you need and the relief you deserve.   Don’t let another PCP/OBGYN write your symptoms off as “normal.”  Instead, book a virtual health assessment with us so we can take a postpartum-specific, customized approach to helping you achieve optimal physical, mental, and emotional health.  Listen, mama, at Postpartum Care USA, we know that recovery is about more than working through anxiety and depression.  It’s about analyzing the signs your body is showing us and helping you find long-lasting relief with the right labs, nutrition, and targeted supplements.   It’s about taking a whole-body approach to feel like the whole woman you are.

After being a nurse/nurse practitioner for 13 years and helping 100’s of mamas prevent and treat postpartum depression, I have learned what it takes to help YOU THRIVE postpartum.  What's the key?  Maternal mental and physical health through EDUCATION from a postpartum expert.    We educate the entire family on what to expect and how to prepare for and significantly reduce the symptoms of baby blues and postpartum depression, and make maternal mental health a priority!  I've uncovered the secrets to thriving during postpartum and I've put them all inside my courses.     Most mamas have prepared for their baby and for birth… and we love that!  BUT what about preparing for beyond birth?  Even I didn't prepare the first time around. I thought I would be equipped to handle my first born and postpartum journey without support.  I was so wrong!   Nothing was what I thought it would be, from labor to breastfeeding to postpartum symptoms.  Everything was SO hard!   Despite having a loving, supportive husband, I felt overwhelmed, scared, and utterly alone.   That's when I realized postpartum care and support in our country was lacking, so I decided to change that!  After months and months of research, diving into the data, and studying international protocols, I've created a business helping moms prevent and treat postpartum anxiety/depression.  Mama, I want to share this information with you!  Beyond Birth: Baby Blues and Postpartum Depression Online Course prepares you and your family for what to expect in the first days, weeks, and months postpartum, so you do not have to struggle with postpartum depression, anxiety or that feeling of being alone.  We are here for you.   You deserve to have a postpartum experience that allows you and your family to thrive, connect, and enjoy this short time with your precious new baby.

EDUCATION.   We need to educate the entire family on what to expect and how to prevent baby blues and postpartum depression.

Everything was SO hard!   Despite having a loving, supportive husband, I felt overwhelmed and alone.   That's when I realized postpartum care and support in our country was lacking, so I decided to change that!

But your kiddos need you to start advocating to get the help you need (and they deserve)…  We’ve been conditioned to believe that postpartum recovery is only 6 weeks long, when in reality – it can go on for YEARS if left untreated. 😣  How you feel today (and have felt for the last few months) doesn’t feel like the woman, mama, or wife you want to be, so how much is it costing you to just accept this as “normal”?  I can tell you…  It’s stripping you of your chance to show your tiny humans the power of self-love and resilience.  It’s forcing you to miss out on precious moments where you’re fully engaged with your family because the physical, mental, and emotional effects of postpartum bog you down.   But here's the thing…  Healthy moms raise healthy kiddos, and healthy wives live in healthy homes. Period.  That’s why we’re creating generational health for postpartum moms.  Many of the mamas in our community start feeling better in as little as 30 days, and you deserve that, too.   You deserve to feel strong and energetic.   You deserve the mental clarity to focus on things you enjoy again (remember when you used to LOVE going to brunch?! 😍)   You deserve to feel like yourself again, Mama, and my team will advocate for you all the way.

But they aren’t.  That’s why you need more than a “typical” doctor visit that brushes your experience off as just “baby blues.”  You need comprehensive postpartum care that gives you expert support, full nutrition analysis, and personalized care plans tailored to what’s *actually* going on inside your body.   Nothing about motherhood is “typical,” and your postpartum care shouldn’t be treated that way.   DM us “HEAL” so we can help you thrive in motherhood – not just survive! ||| If your postpartum labs came back “normal,” but you’re still experiencing hair loss, weight gain, irritability, or low libido, it could mean your PCP/OBGYN isn’t drawing enough tests.

Not only have I gone through postpartum 3 times in 4 years but…   I’m a Nurse Practitioner specializing in postpartum care. I’ve helped 2500 mamas reclaim their physical, mental, and emotional health after giving birth because I know firsthand that basic lab tests won’t cut it.  That’s why at Postpartum Care USA, we draw 55+ labs that focus on your thyroid health, nutrient deficiencies, hormonal imbalances, metabolic panels, and so much more.   You shouldn’t have to accept things like ❌weight gain, ❌chronic fatigue, ❌low libido, or ❌mom brain as your “new normal”, mama.

But your kiddos need you to start advocating to get the help you need (and they deserve)…  We’ve been conditioned to believe that postpartum recovery is only 6 weeks long, when in reality – it can go on for YEARS if left untreated. 😣  How you feel today (and have felt for the last few months) doesn’t feel like the woman, mama, or wife you want to be, so how much is it costing you to just accept this as “normal”?

It’s forcing you to miss out on precious moments where you’re fully engaged with your family because the physical, mental, and emotional effects of postpartum bog you down.

You know how infuriating it is.

Mama, it’s not normal. And it’s definitely not in your head.

These are nutrient, thyroid, and inflammation issues hiding in the labs your OB never ran.

We’ve tested over 3,300 women, and the data is clear:

✅ 91% had nutrient deficiencies
✅ 73% had thyroid issues
✅ 58% had inflammation missed on basic labs

You think it’s all happening because you’re not doing enough. Not eating right. Not working out. Not disciplined.

The truth is: these symptoms are likely from nutrient depletion. ‼️

After birth, your body goes through the most nutrient-depleting event it will ever experience.

Out of 3,300 + women we tested, 91% had nutrient deficiencies.

Which means… it’s real, trackable, AND fixable! 💛

Hi! 👋 I’m Stacia Scott! Not only have I gone through postpartum 3 times in 4 years but… 

I’m a Nurse Practitioner specializing in postpartum care. I’ve helped 2500 mamas reclaim their physical, mental, and emotional health after giving birth because I know firsthand that basic lab tests won’t cut it.

That’s why at Postpartum Care USA, we draw 55+ labs that focus on your thyroid health, nutrient deficiencies, hormonal imbalances, metabolic panels, and so much more.

You think it’s all happening because you’re not doing enough. Not eating right. Not working out. Not disciplined.

The truth is: these symptoms are likely from nutrient depletion. ‼️

After birth, your body goes through the most nutrient-depleting event it will ever experience.

Out of 3,300 + women we tested, 91% had nutrient deficiencies.

Which means… it’s real, trackable, AND fixable! 💛

I’m a Nurse Practitioner specializing in postpartum care. I’ve helped 2500 mamas reclaim their physical, mental, and emotional health after giving birth because I know firsthand that basic lab tests won’t cut it.

Hi! 👋 I’m Stacia Scott! Not only have I gone through postpartum 3 times in 4 years but… 

I’m a Nurse Practitioner specializing in postpartum care. I’ve helped 2500 mamas reclaim their physical, mental, and emotional health after giving birth because I know firsthand that basic lab tests won’t cut it.

That’s why at Postpartum Care USA, we draw 55+ labs that focus on your thyroid health, nutrient deficiencies, hormonal imbalances, metabolic panels, and so much more. 

You shouldn’t have to accept things like ❌weight gain, ❌chronic fatigue, ❌low libido, or ❌mom brain as your “new normal”, mama. 

I want to help you get the in-depth testing you need to get to the root of these postpartum symptoms for good.

Your OB says your labs are “normal.”

Friends say, “That’s just mom life.”

But you know better.

Because normal doesn’t feel like:

😩 Fatigue that doesn’t lift no matter how much coffee you drink.
😶‍🌫️ Brain fog so heavy you forget words mid-sentence.
💔 Libido that never came back.

Your OB says your labs are “normal.”

Friends say, “That’s just mom life.”

But you know better.

Because normal doesn’t feel like:

😩 Fatigue that doesn’t lift no matter how much coffee you drink.
😶‍🌫️ Brain fog so heavy you forget words mid-sentence.
💔 Libido that never came back.

Here’s the problem: most OBs only test 5–7 markers.

Hi! 👋 I’m Stacia Scott! Not only have I gone through postpartum 3 times in 4 years but… 

I’m a Nurse Practitioner specializing in postpartum care. I’ve helped 2500 mamas reclaim their physical, mental, and emotional health after giving birth because I know firsthand that basic lab tests won’t cut it.

That’s why at Postpartum Care USA, we draw 55+ labs that focus on your thyroid health, nutrient deficiencies, hormonal imbalances, metabolic panels, and so much more. 

You shouldn’t have to accept things like ❌weight gain, ❌chronic fatigue, ❌low libido, or ❌mom brain as your “new normal”, mama. 

I want to help you get the in-depth testing you need to get to the root of these postpartum symptoms for good.

You *know* something just isn’t right. You *still* don’t feel like yourself, and these symptoms haven’t just “gone away” like your PCP/OBGYN promised they would. 🤔

Mama, your PCP/OBGYN will tell you chronic fatigue, mom brain, and weight gain are “normal” after giving birth, but as postpartum experts, we’re here to tell you it’s NOT. 

Every mama’s journey is unique, but after months (or even years) of feeling this way…

You *know* something just isn’t right. You *still* don’t feel like yourself, and these symptoms haven’t just “gone away” like your PCP/OBGYN promised they would. 🤔

That’s because these are all signs of Postnatal Depletion Syndrome (or PND), and not only do they affect your physical health…they can also affect your mental health, too.

But at Postpartum Care USA, we get to the root cause of these symptoms so you can get back to the root of who you are (you know…fun, vibrant, free 🤍)...
