Analyze the conversion funnel for $ARGUMENTS.

Use the analytics-agent subagent to:
1. Query stage-by-stage breakdown with counts and percentages
2. Calculate conversion rates between each stage
3. Identify drop-off points (where we lose the most people)
4. Present results as a markdown table with insights and recommendations

If no time range is specified, default to "last 30 days".
