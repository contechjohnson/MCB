AD_ID ATTRIBUTION GAP INVESTIGATION - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Date: November 14, 2025
Period: November 7-14, 2025

========================================
KEY FINDINGS
========================================

1. CAPTURE RATE: 39.6% (338 of 853 contacts have ad_id)
   - Historical baseline: 35%
   - Current: Slight improvement but still critical

2. MISSING ATTRIBUTION BREAKDOWN:
   - Instagram (no ad_id): 478 contacts, $8,790 revenue, 4 purchases
   - Instagram (WITH ad_id): 335 contacts, $2,997 revenue, 1 purchase
   - Website (no ad_id): 37 contacts, $8,244 revenue, 3 purchases
   
3. REVENUE WITHOUT ATTRIBUTION: $11,034 (78% of total purchases)
   - Instagram no ad_id: $8,790 (4 purchases)
   - Website: $8,244 (3 purchases)
   
4. DUPLICATE AD NAMES: 3 ads causing attribution confusion
   - MC22 (VSLQ2 Video)
   - MC39 (15mo Postpartum Carousel)
   - MC31 (Still Exhausted Carousel)

5. CPL DISCREPANCIES:
   - Best: MC39 at $0.55 CPL (20 contacts, $10.92 spend)
   - Worst: AG: MC62 at $43.18 CPL vs Meta's $10.53 (4.1x variance!)
   - Meta reports 41 leads, we only captured 10 contacts (75% loss)

========================================
ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
========================================

PRIMARY: Organic Instagram Traffic (LIKELY)
- 398 contacts have MC_ID but no ad_id
- Chatbot variants A & B (Oct 30) affected equally
- Likely organic profile clicks, story mentions, direct DMs

SECONDARY: ManyChat Parameter Capture Issues (POSSIBLE)
- 40% capture rate proves system CAN work
- May be missing ad_id={{ad.id}} in some ad links
- Trigger words mostly null (placeholder values)

CONFIRMED: Website Traffic Working as Intended
- 37 contacts without ad_id (expected for direct/SEO traffic)
- High conversion rate (59% form submission)

PARTIAL: BOF Funnel Working
- 44 contacts with ad_id but no MC_ID
- Attribution captured for direct-to-funnel traffic

========================================
IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED
========================================

1. AUDIT MANYCHAT AD LINKS
   - Check for ad_id={{ad.id}} parameter in all active ads
   - Test end-to-end: ad click → ManyChat → webhook → database
   
2. ADD ORGANIC VS PAID TRACKING
   - Use trigger_word to separate paid vs organic
   - Add traffic_type custom field
   
3. FIX DUPLICATE AD NAMES
   - Rename MC22, MC39, MC31 duplicates
   - Add (v2), (v3) suffixes
   
4. INVESTIGATE AG: MC62
   - 75% attribution loss (41 Meta leads vs 10 our contacts)
   - Check landing page and tracking setup

========================================
MEDIUM-TERM IMPROVEMENTS
========================================

5. Align "contact" definition with Meta "lead" definition
6. Automate weekly attribution health reports
7. Track CPL variance alerts
8. Add funnel stage to CPL calculations

========================================
LONG-TERM STRATEGY
========================================

9. Separate instagram_organic vs instagram_paid sources
10. Build real-time attribution health dashboard
11. Add profile_link, story_click source tracking

========================================
BUSINESS IMPACT
========================================

POSITIVE:
- Organic Instagram traffic converting BETTER than paid (3x revenue)
- Website traffic highly qualified (59% form submission rate)
- System captures 40% of paid traffic (proves it works)

NEGATIVE:
- Cannot attribute $11K in revenue to specific ads
- Cannot calculate true ROAS without organic separation
- Some ads show 75% attribution loss

PRIORITY: MEDIUM-HIGH
- Not a broken system, but needs organic/paid separation
- Revenue is being captured, just not attributed correctly
- Fix will enable accurate ROAS and ad performance analysis

========================================
DATA QUALITY NOTES
========================================

- Total contacts (Nov 7-14): 853
- Historical data excluded (source != 'instagram_historical')
- All queries filtered by date range: >= 2025-11-07
- Meta insights from last 7 days
- CPL calculations use meta_ad_insights (weekly spend)
