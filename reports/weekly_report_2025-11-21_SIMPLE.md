# Weekly Report - Nov 13-20, 2025

## Which Report is Correct?

**Both are correct, they measure different things:**

| | Ad Team (Meta) | Our Report |
|--|----------------|------------|
| **What it measures** | Only Meta-attributed sales | ALL sales (attributed + unattributed) |
| **Revenue** | $31,175 | **$55,254** |
| **Purchases** | 12 | **22** |
| **ROAS** | 2.08x | **4.3x** |

The ad team only sees what Meta's pixel can track. We see everything - including website traffic, organic, and sales where attribution was lost.
