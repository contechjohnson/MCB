## Comparison to Payments Table

### Payments in Date Range (Nov 6-13)

**Total Payments Recorded:** 4 payments  
**Total Payment Amount:** $11,988.00

### Payment Breakdown

| Payment Date | Customer Name | Email | Amount | Source | Contact Match |
|--------------|---------------|-------|--------|--------|---------------|
| Nov 6, 4:30 PM | Rebekah Segarra | hoyt.rebekah@gmail.com | $2,997 | Stripe | ✅ Linked (different contact) |
| Nov 7, 6:47 PM | Lauren Toledo | ltd8587@gmail.com | $2,997 | Stripe | ✅ Linked |
| Nov 8, 2:14 AM | Ryan Giolitto | birtha56@aim.com | $2,997 | Stripe | ✅ Linked |
| Nov 10, 9:23 PM | Matthew Olsen | liane.joshua@gmail.com | $2,997 | Stripe | ✅ Linked |

### Orphan Payment Analysis

**Orphan Payments (No contact_id):** 0 payments  
**Orphan Rate:** 0.0% 🎉

**EXCELLENT:** All 4 payments successfully linked to contacts!

### Discrepancy Investigation

**Issue:** 4 payments in date range, but only 3 contacts with `purchase_date` in range.

**Explanation:**
- **Payment #1** (Rebekah Segarra - Nov 6, 4:30 PM) has `contact_id = 04df40a8-2f62-46a8-8401-52b0b36dd580`
- This contact likely has `purchase_date` **before** Nov 6 or **after** Nov 13
- Payment was captured Nov 6, but contact's `purchase_date` may differ due to timezone or webhook timing

**Action Item:** Query contact `04df40a8-2f62-46a8-8401-52b0b36dd580` to verify `purchase_date` field.

### Payment Method Distribution

| Payment Method | Count | Total Amount | Avg Amount |
|----------------|-------|--------------|------------|
| **Stripe** | 4 | $11,988.00 | $2,997.00 |
| **Denefits** | 0 | $0.00 | N/A |

**Note:** All payments this week were "Buy in Full" via Stripe. No BNPL financing.

## Revenue by Source

### Source Performance

| Source | Revenue | Purchases | Avg Order Value | % of Total Revenue |
|--------|---------|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Website** | $5,994.00 | 2 | $2,997.00 | 66.7% |
| **Instagram** | $2,997.00 | 1 | $2,997.00 | 33.3% |

### Source Insights

1. **Website Dominance:** Website traffic generated 67% of revenue this week
2. **Consistent AOV:** Both sources maintained $2,997 price point (no discounts)
3. **Instagram Performance:** 1 Instagram DM purchase with full attribution data
4. **No Paid Attribution:** Zero purchases attributed to Meta Ads (all organic or direct)

---

## Additional Findings & Observations

### Data Quality

**Excellent:**
- ✅ 100% GHL linkage (all purchases have `ghl_id`)
- ✅ 0% orphan payment rate (all payments matched)
- ✅ Perfect payment tracking (4 payments, 4 links)

**Good:**
- ✅ 33% MC linkage (expected, since 2 came from website)
- ✅ Full conversation data for Instagram DM purchase

**Needs Improvement:**
- ⚠️ 0% ad attribution (no `ad_id` captured)
- ⚠️ Missing `appointment_date` field (only `appointment_held_date`)
- ⚠️ Missing `form_submit_date` for website leads

### Customer Behavior Patterns

1. **Spouse Payment Pattern:** 2 of 3 payments were made by spouse (Ryan paid for Lauren G., Matthew paid for Liane O.)
2. **Fast Decision Makers:** All 3 converted same day or within 2 days of appointment
3. **Low Checkout Abandonment:** All 3 completed checkout within minutes of starting
4. **Trust in System:** No refunds or chargebacks

### Entry Point Analysis

**Website (2 purchases):**
- Direct to appointment booking
- No DM qualification required
- Same-day conversion from appointment
- Perfect GHL tracking

**Instagram DM Flow (1 purchase):**
- Full funnel: subscribe → qualify → link sent → appointment → purchase
- 2-day conversion cycle
- Complete conversation data captured
- Perfect MC + GHL linkage

---

## Recommendations

### Short-Term Actions

1. **Investigate Missing Purchase Date:**
   - Query contact `04df40a8-2f62-46a8-8401-52b0b36dd580` (Rebekah Segarra)
   - Verify why payment date (Nov 6) doesn't match purchase date in contacts table
   - May reveal webhook timing issues

2. **Improve Ad Attribution:**
   - Review ManyChat webhook parameters for ad_id capture
   - Test Meta Ads parameter passing
   - Current 0% capture rate prevents ROAS calculation

3. **Capture Form Submit Date:**
   - Website leads are missing `form_submit_date`
   - GHL webhook should set this when booking form submitted
   - Would provide complete timeline for website funnel

### Long-Term Strategy

1. **Website Optimization:**
   - Website generating 67% of revenue with faster conversions
   - Consider increasing website traffic investment
   - Track website traffic source (organic, referral, etc.)

2. **DM Flow Refinement:**
   - Instagram DM flow has complete data and good conversion
   - Only 1 sample this week - need more volume
   - Consider A/B testing DM qualification questions

3. **Attribution Infrastructure:**
   - Need ad_id capture for Meta Ads ROAS
   - Consider UTM parameters for website traffic
   - Track referral sources more granularly

## CRITICAL UPDATE: Webhook Issues Discovered

### Issue #1: Stripe Webhook Not Updating Contacts Table

**Discovery:** Payment for Rebekah Segarra (Nov 6, $2,997) has NO corresponding `purchase_date` in contacts table.

**Details:**
- **Payment Record:** Created Nov 6 at 4:30 PM UTC
- **Contact Record:** `purchase_date = NULL`, `purchase_amount = NULL`
- **Contact ID:** `04df40a8-2f62-46a8-8401-52b0b36dd580`
- **Email Match:** `hoyt.rebekah@gmail.com` (matches payment)
- **Payment Linked:** ✅ Payment has `contact_id` 
- **Contact Updated:** ❌ Contact NOT updated with purchase data

**Root Cause:** Stripe webhook successfully:
1. ✅ Created payment record
2. ✅ Linked payment to contact (via email match)
3. ❌ **FAILED** to update contact's `purchase_date` and `purchase_amount` fields

**Impact:**
- Contact appears as "not purchased" in contacts table
- Funnel analytics undercount purchases
- Revenue attribution incomplete
- This is a **CRITICAL** data integrity issue

**Action Required:**
- Review `/app/api/stripe-webhook/route.ts` 
- Ensure Stripe webhook updates contact record when payment succeeds
- Should update: `purchase_date`, `purchase_amount`, `stage = 'purchased'`

---

### Issue #2: Denefits Purchase Date Timing

**Discovery:** Sara Nesbit's Denefits payment shows different dates.

**Details:**
- **Payment Date:** Nov 11 at 8:45 PM UTC (Denefits webhook)
- **Contact Purchase Date:** Nov 13 at 10:20 PM UTC (2 days later)
- **Difference:** 48 hours between payment and contact update

**Likely Explanation:**
- Denefits webhook creates payment record immediately (Nov 11)
- Denefits webhook updates contact later or via separate process
- Contact `purchase_date` reflects when webhook updated contact, not when payment occurred

**Impact:**
- Time-to-purchase metrics distorted
- Date range queries may miss purchases (payment vs contact date mismatch)
- Revenue attribution timing unclear

**Recommendation:**
- Use `payments.payment_date` as source of truth for purchase timing
- Consider updating contact `purchase_date` to match payment date
- Or add documentation that Denefits has 48-hour lag

---

## CORRECTED: True Purchase Count (Including Webhook Failures)

### Actual Purchases This Week

| Date | Customer | Amount | Source | Payment Table | Contacts Table | Issue |
|------|----------|--------|--------|---------------|----------------|-------|
| Nov 6 | Rebekah Segarra | $2,997 | Stripe | ✅ Recorded | ❌ **MISSING** | Webhook failure |
| Nov 7 | Lauren Toledo | $2,997 | Stripe | ✅ Recorded | ✅ Recorded | None |
| Nov 8 | Lauren Giolitto | $2,997 | Stripe | ✅ Recorded | ✅ Recorded | None |
| Nov 10 | Liane Olsen | $2,997 | Stripe | ✅ Recorded | ✅ Recorded | None |
| Nov 11 | Sara Nesbit | $3,296 | Denefits | ✅ Recorded | ⚠️ Wrong date (Nov 13) | Timing lag |

### Corrected Totals

**Based on Payments Table (Source of Truth):**
- **Total Purchases:** 5 purchases (not 3)
- **Total Revenue:** $14,985.00 (not $8,991.00)
- **Stripe Revenue:** $11,988.00 (4 purchases)
- **Denefits Revenue:** $3,296.00 (1 purchase)
- **Average Order Value:** $2,997.00
- **Denefits Financed Amount:** $3,296 @ 19.9% APR (12 monthly payments of $274.67)

### Payment Method Breakdown (CORRECTED)

| Payment Method | Count | Total Revenue | % of Revenue |
|----------------|-------|---------------|--------------|
| Stripe (Buy in Full) | 4 | $11,988.00 | 80.0% |
| Denefits (BNPL) | 1 | $3,296.00 | 20.0% |

## URGENT: Data Integrity Issues

### Severity: HIGH

**Problem:** Contacts table is missing 1 confirmed purchase and has incorrect date for another.

**Missing Purchase:**
- Rebekah Segarra paid $2,997 on Nov 6
- Payment successfully recorded and linked
- Contact record NEVER updated with purchase data
- **Data Loss:** Contact appears unpurchased despite payment

**Date Mismatch:**
- Sara Nesbit paid $3,296 on Nov 11 (Denefits)
- Contact shows purchase date as Nov 13 (2 days later)
- **Data Skew:** Journey metrics incorrect by 48 hours

### Root Cause Analysis

**Stripe Webhook Issue:**
```typescript
// Expected behavior (not happening):
await supabase
  .from('contacts')
  .update({
    purchase_date: payment_date,
    purchase_amount: amount,
    stage: 'purchased'
  })
  .eq('id', contact_id);
```

**Current behavior:** Payment linked, but contact not updated.

### Recommended Fixes

1. **Immediate:**
   - Manually update Rebekah's contact: `purchase_date = '2025-11-06T16:30:47+00:00'`, `purchase_amount = 2997`, `stage = 'purchased'`
   - Manually update Sara's contact: `purchase_date = '2025-11-11T20:45:06+00:00'` (change from Nov 13 to Nov 11)

2. **Code Fix:**
   - Review `/app/api/stripe-webhook/route.ts`
   - Ensure `checkout.session.completed` event updates contact record
   - Add logging to track when contact updates fail
   - Consider adding retry logic for failed updates

3. **Validation:**
   - Create daily check: payments with `contact_id` but contact has `purchase_date = NULL`
   - Alert on mismatches
   - Backfill missing data

---

## Updated SQL Queries

### Query to Find All Webhook Failures
```sql
-- Find payments that linked to contact but didn't update purchase_date
SELECT 
  p.payment_date,
  p.customer_name,
  p.customer_email,
  p.amount,
  p.payment_source,
  c.purchase_date,
  c.purchase_amount,
  c.stage
FROM payments p
JOIN contacts c ON p.contact_id = c.id
WHERE c.purchase_date IS NULL OR c.purchase_amount IS NULL;
```

**Expected Result:** Should find Rebekah Segarra's record.

### Query to Fix Rebekah's Record
```sql
UPDATE contacts
SET 
  purchase_date = '2025-11-06T16:30:47+00:00',
  purchase_amount = 2997,
  stage = 'purchased',
  updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id = '04df40a8-2f62-46a8-8401-52b0b36dd580';
```

### Query to Fix Sara's Date
```sql
UPDATE contacts
SET 
  purchase_date = '2025-11-11T20:45:06+00:00',
  updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id = '82cb7ea4-ce54-4ce5-9280-73851f06b312';
```

---

## Final Summary (With Corrections)

### True Performance (Nov 6-13, 2025)

- **Actual Purchases:** 5 (not 3 reported)
- **Actual Revenue:** $14,985.00 (not $8,991.00 reported)
- **Webhook Accuracy:** 60% (3 of 5 purchases correctly recorded in contacts table)
- **Payment Linking:** 100% (all 5 payments linked to contacts)
- **Data Integrity:** COMPROMISED (40% of purchases missing/incorrect in contacts)

### Source Breakdown (CORRECTED)

Assuming Rebekah and Sara are Instagram sources (based on historical data):

| Source | Purchases | Revenue | % of Revenue |
