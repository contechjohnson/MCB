🎯 KEY INSIGHTS & RECOMMENDATIONS

✅ **WHAT'S WORKING:**

1. **Revenue is STRONG** - $44,843 this week from 18 payments
2. **Close rate is excellent** - 46% meeting-to-purchase
3. **BOF funnel is active** - 23 contacts went straight to booking (12% of traffic)
4. **Meeting show-up rate improved** - 17% form-to-meeting (up from 7% last week!)

⚠️ **NEEDS ATTENTION:**

1. **Attribution at 37.9% for TOF/MOF** - Could be:
   - Old subscribers from before attribution went live (most likely)
   - Organic Instagram DMs
   - Need 1-2 more weeks to see true rate for new contacts

2. **Ad spend data missing** - Run Meta sync to calculate weekly ROAS

🎬 **ACTION ITEMS:**

1. **MONITOR: Meeting show-up rate** - Now at 17% (improved from 7% last week!)

2. **RUN: Meta Ads sync**
   - Need current spend data for accurate ROAS
